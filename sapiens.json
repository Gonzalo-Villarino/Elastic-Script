The story of these\nfundamental features of our universe is called physics.\nAbout 300,000 years after their appearance, matter and energy started\nto coalesce into complex structures, called atoms, which then combined\ninto molecules. The story of atoms, molecules and their interactions is\ncalled chemistry.\nAbout 3.8 billion years ago, on a planet called Earth, certain molecules\ncombined to form particularly large and intricate structures called\norganisms. The story of organisms is called biology.\nAbout 70,000 years ago, organisms belonging to the species Homo\nsapiens started to form even more elaborate structures called cultures.\nThe subsequent development of these human cultures is called history.\nThree important revolutions shaped the course of history: the\nCognitive Revolution kick-started history about 70,000 years ago. The\nAgricultural Revolution sped it up about 12,000 years ago. The Scientific\nRevolution, which got under way only 500 years ago, may well end\nhistory and start something completely different. This book tells the\nstory of how these three revolutions have affected humans and their\nfellow organisms.\nThere were humans long before there was history. Animals much like\nmodern humans first appeared about 2.5 million years ago. But for\ncountless generations they did not stand out from the myriad other\norganisms with which they shared their habitats."

        "content": "On a hike in East Africa 2 million years ago, you might well have\nencountered a familiar cast of human characters: anxious mothers\ncuddling their babies and clutches of carefree children playing in the\nmud; temperamental youths chafing against the dictates of society and\nweary elders who just wanted to be left in peace; chest-thumping\nmachos trying to impress the local beauty and wise old matriarchs who\nhad already seen it all. These archaic humans loved, played, formed\nclose friendships and competed for status and power – but so did\nchimpanzees, baboons and elephants. There was nothing special about\nthem. Nobody, least of all humans themselves, had any inkling that their\ndescendants would one day walk on the moon, split the atom, fathom\nthe genetic code and write history books. The most important thing to\nknow about prehistoric humans is that they were insignificant animals\nwith no more impact on their environment than gorillas, fireflies or\njellyfish.\nBiologists classify organisms into species. Animals are said to belong\nto the same species if they tend to mate with each other, giving birth to\nfertile offspring. Horses and donkeys have a recent common ancestor\nand share many physical traits. But they show little sexual interest in\none another. They will mate if induced to do so – but their offspring,\ncalled mules, are sterile. Mutations in donkey DNA can therefore never\ncross over to horses, or vice versa. The two types of animals are\nconsequently considered two distinct species, moving along separate\nevolutionary paths. By contrast, a bulldog and a spaniel may look very\ndifferent, but they are members of the same species, sharing the same\nDNA pool. They will happily mate and their puppies will grow up to pair\noff with other dogs and produce more puppies.\nSpecies that evolved from a common ancestor are bunched together\nunder the heading ‘genus’ (plural genera). Lions, tigers, leopards and\njaguars are different species within the genus Panthera. Biologists label\norganisms with a two-part Latin name, genus followed by species. Lions,\nfor example, are called Panthera leo, the species leo of the genus\nPanthera. Presumably, everyone reading this book is a Homo sapiens – the\nspecies sapiens (wise) of the genus Homo (man).\nGenera in their turn are grouped into families, such as the cats (lions,\ncheetahs, house cats), the dogs (wolves, foxes, jackals) and the elephants\n(elephants, mammoths, mastodons).

All cats, for example,\nfrom the smallest house kitten to the most ferocious lion, share a\ncommon feline ancestor who lived about 25 million years ago.\nHomo sapiens, too, belongs to a family. This banal fact used to be one\nof history’s most closely guarded secrets. Homo sapiens long preferred to\nview itself as set apart from animals, an orphan bereft of family, lacking\nsiblings or cousins, and most importantly, without parents. But that’s\njust not the case. Like it or not, we are members of a large and\nparticularly noisy family called the great apes. Our closest living\nrelatives include chimpanzees, gorillas and orang-utans. The\nchimpanzees are the closest. Just 6 million years ago, a single female ape\nhad two daughters. One became the ancestor of all chimpanzees, the\nother is our own grandmother.\nSkeletons in the Closet\nHomo sapiens has kept hidden an even more disturbing secret. Not only\ndo we possess an abundance of uncivilised cousins, once upon a time we\nhad quite a few brothers and sisters as well. We are used to thinking\nabout ourselves as the only humans, because for the last 10,000 years,\nour species has indeed been the only human species around. Yet the real\nmeaning of the word human is ‘an animal belonging to the genus Homo’,\nand there used to be many other species of this genus besides Homo\nsapiens. Moreover, as we shall see in the last chapter of the book, in the\nnot so distant future we might again have to contend with non-sapiens\nhumans. To clarify this point, I will often use the term ‘Sapiens’ to\ndenote members of the species Homo sapiens, while reserving the term\n‘human’ to refer to all extant members of the genus Homo.\nHumans first evolved in East Africa about 2.5 million years ago from\nan earlier genus of apes called Australopithecus, which means ‘Southern\nApe’. About 2 million years ago, some of these archaic men and women\nleft their homeland to journey through and settle vast areas of North\nAfrica, Europe and Asia. Since survival in the snowy forests of northern\nEurope required different traits than those needed to stay alive in\nIndonesia’s steaming jungles, human populations evolved in different"

Our siblings, according to speculative reconstructions (left to right):\nHomo rudolfensis (East Africa); Homo erectus (East Asia); and Homo neanderthalensis\n(Europe and western Asia). All are humans.\nHumans in Europe and western Asia evolved into Homo\nneanderthalensis (‘Man from the Neander Valley), popularly referred to\nsimply as ‘Neanderthals’. Neanderthals, bulkier and more muscular than\nus Sapiens, were well adapted to the cold climate of Ice Age western\nEurasia. The more eastern regions of Asia were populated by Homo\nerectus, ‘Upright Man’, who survived there for close to 2 million years,\nmaking it the most durable human species ever. This record is unlikely\nto be broken even by our own species. It is doubtful whether Homo\nsapiens will still be around a thousand years from now, so 2 million years\nis really out of our league.\nOn the island of Java, in Indonesia, lived Homo soloensis, ‘Man from\nthe Solo Valley’, who was suited to life in the tropics. On another\nIndonesian island – the small island of Flores – archaic humans\nunderwent a process of dwarfing. Humans first reached Flores when the\nsea level was exceptionally low, and the island was easily accessible\nfrom the mainland. When the seas rose again, some people were trapped\non the island, which was poor in resources. Big people, who need a lot of\nfood, died first. Smaller fellows survived much better. Over the"

This unique species,\nknown by scientists as Homo floresiensis, reached a maximum height of\nonly one metre and weighed no more than twenty-five kilograms. They\nwere nevertheless able to produce stone tools, and even managed\noccasionally to hunt down some of the island’s elephants – though, to be\nfair, the elephants were a dwarf species as well.\nIn 2010 another lost sibling was rescued from oblivion, when\nscientists excavating the Denisova Cave in Siberia discovered a fossilised\nfinger bone. Genetic analysis proved that the finger belonged to a\npreviously unknown human species, which was named Homo denisova.\nWho knows how many lost relatives of ours are waiting to be discovered\nin other caves, on other islands, and in other climes.\nWhile these humans were evolving in Europe and Asia, evolution in\nEast Africa did not stop. The cradle of humanity continued to nurture\nnumerous new species, such as Homo rudolfensis, ‘Man from Lake\nRudolf’, Homo ergaster, ‘Working Man’, and eventually our own species,\nwhich we’ve immodestly named Homo sapiens, ‘Wise Man’.\nThe members of some of these species were massive and others were\ndwarves. Some were fearsome hunters and others meek plant-gatherers.\nSome lived only on a single island, while many roamed over continents.\nBut all of them belonged to the genus Homo. They were all human\nbeings.\nIt’s a common fallacy to envision these species as arranged in a\nstraight line of descent, with Ergaster begetting Erectus, Erectus\nbegetting the Neanderthals, and the Neanderthals evolving into us. This\nlinear model gives the mistaken impression that at any particular\nmoment only one type of human inhabited the earth, and that all earlier\nspecies were merely older models of ourselves. The truth is that from\nabout 2 million years ago until around 10,000 years ago, the world was\nhome, at one and the same time, to several human species. And why\nnot? Today there are many species of foxes, bears and pigs. The earth of\na hundred millennia ago was walked by at least six different species of\nman. It’s our current exclusivity, not that multi-species past, that is\npeculiar – and perhaps incriminating. As we will shortly see, we Sapiens\nhave good reasons to repress the memory of our siblings."

        "content": "The Cost of Thinking\nDespite their many differences, all human species share several defining\ncharacteristics. Most notably, humans have extraordinarily large brains\ncompared to other animals. Mammals weighing sixty kilograms have an\naverage brain size of 200 cubic centimetres. The earliest men and\nwomen, 2.5 million years ago, had brains of about 600 cubic\ncentimetres. Modern Sapiens sport a brain averaging 1,200–1,400 cubic\ncentimetres. Neanderthal brains were even bigger.\nThat evolution should select for larger brains may seem to us like,\nwell, a no-brainer. We are so enamoured of our high intelligence that we\nassume that when it comes to cerebral power, more must be better. But\nif that were the case, the feline family would also have produced cats\nwho could do calculus. Why is genus Homo the only one in the entire\nanimal kingdom to have come up with such massive thinking machines?\nThe fact is that a jumbo brain is a jumbo drain on the body. It’s not\neasy to carry around, especially when encased inside a massive skull. It’s\neven harder to fuel. In Homo sapiens, the brain accounts for about 2–3\nper cent of total body weight, but it consumes 25 per cent of the body’s\nenergy when the body is at rest. By comparison, the brains of other apes\nrequire only 8 per cent of rest-time energy. Archaic humans paid for\ntheir large brains in two ways. Firstly, they spent more time in search of\nfood. Secondly, their muscles atrophied. Like a government diverting\nmoney from defence to education, humans diverted energy from biceps\nto neurons. It’s hardly a foregone conclusion that this is a good strategy\nfor survival on the savannah. A chimpanzee can’t win an argument with\na Homo sapiens, but the ape can rip the man apart like a rag doll.\nToday our big brains pay off nicely, because we can produce cars and\nguns that enable us to move much faster than chimps, and shoot them\nfrom a safe distance instead of wrestling. But cars and guns are a recent\nphenomenon. For more than 2 million years, human neural networks\nkept growing and growing, but apart from some flint knives and pointed\nsticks, humans had precious little to show for it. What then drove\nforward the evolution of the massive human brain during those 2 million\nyears? Frankly, we don’t know.\nAnother singular human trait is that we walk upright on two legs."

The more things these hands could do,\nthe more successful their owners were, so evolutionary pressure brought\nabout an increasing concentration of nerves and finely tuned muscles in\nthe palms and fingers. As a result, humans can perform very intricate\ntasks with their hands. In particular, they can produce and use\nsophisticated tools. The first evidence for tool production dates from\nabout 2.5 million years ago, and the manufacture and use of tools are\nthe criteria by which archaeologists recognise ancient humans.\nYet walking upright has its downside. The skeleton of our primate\nancestors developed for millions of years to support a creature that\nwalked on all fours and had a relatively small head. Adjusting to an\nupright position was quite a challenge, especially when the scaffolding\nhad to support an extra-large cranium. Humankind paid for its lofty\nvision and industrious hands with backaches and stiff necks.\nWomen paid extra. An upright gait required narrower hips,\nconstricting the birth canal – and this just when babies’ heads were\ngetting bigger and bigger. Death in childbirth became a major hazard for\nhuman females. Women who gave birth earlier, when the infants brain\nand head were still relatively small and supple, fared better and lived to\nhave more children. Natural selection consequently favoured earlier\nbirths. And, indeed, compared to other animals, humans are born\nprematurely, when many of their vital systems are still underdeveloped.\nA colt can trot shortly after birth; a kitten leaves its mother to forage on\nits own when it is just a few weeks old. Human babies are helpless,\ndependent for many years on their elders for sustenance, protection and\neducation.\nThis fact has contributed greatly both to humankind’s extraordinary\nsocial abilities and to its unique social problems. Lone mothers could\nhardly forage enough food for their offspring and themselves with needy\nchildren in tow. Raising children required constant help from other\nfamily members and neighbours. It takes a tribe to raise a human.\nEvolution thus favoured those capable of forming strong social ties. In\naddition, since humans are born underdeveloped, they can be educated\nand socialised to a far greater extent than any other animal.

They\ncan be spun, stretched and shaped with a surprising degree of freedom.\nThis is why today we can educate our children to become Christian or\nBuddhist, capitalist or socialist, warlike or peace-loving.\n*\nWe assume that a large brain, the use of tools, superior learning abilities\nand complex social structures are huge advantages. It seems self-evident\nthat these have made humankind the most powerful animal on earth.\nBut humans enjoyed all of these advantages for a full 2 million years\nduring which they remained weak and marginal creatures. Thus humans\nwho lived a million years ago, despite their big brains and sharp stone\ntools, dwelt in constant fear of predators, rarely hunted large game, and\nsubsisted mainly by gathering plants, scooping up insects, stalking small\nanimals, and eating the carrion left behind by other more powerful\ncarnivores.\nOne of the most common uses of early stone tools was to crack open\nbones in order to get to the marrow. Some researchers believe this was\nour original niche. Just as woodpeckers specialise in extracting insects\nfrom the trunks of trees, the first humans specialised in extracting\nmarrow from bones. Why marrow? Well, suppose you observe a pride of\nlions take down and devour a giraffe. You wait patiently until they’re\ndone. But it’s still not your turn because first the hyenas and jackals –\nand you don’t dare interfere with them scavenge the leftovers. Only then\nwould you and your band dare approach the carcass, look cautiously left\nand right – and dig into the edible tissue that remained.\nThis is a key to understanding our history and psychology. Genus\nHomo’s position in the food chain was, until quite recently, solidly in the\nmiddle. For millions of years, humans hunted smaller creatures and\ngathered what they could, all the while being hunted by larger\npredators. It was only 400,000 years ago that several species of man\nbegan to hunt large game on a regular basis, and only in the last\n100,000 years – with the rise of Homo sapiens – that man jumped to the\ntop of the food chain.\nThat spectacular leap from the middle to the top had enormous"

Other animals at the top of the pyramid, such as lions and\nsharks, evolved into that position very gradually, over millions of years.\nThis enabled the ecosystem to develop checks and balances that prevent\nlions and sharks from wreaking too much havoc. As lions became\ndeadlier, so gazelles evolved to run faster, hyenas to cooperate better,\nand rhinoceroses to be more bad-tempered. In contrast, humankind\nascended to the top so quickly that the ecosystem was not given time to\nadjust. Moreover, humans themselves failed to adjust. Most top\npredators of the planet are majestic creatures. Millions of years of\ndominion have filled them with self-confidence. Sapiens by contrast is\nmore like a banana republic dictator. Having so recently been one of the\nunderdogs of the savannah, we are full of fears and anxieties over our\nposition, which makes us doubly cruel and dangerous. Many historical\ncalamities, from deadly wars to ecological catastrophes, have resulted\nfrom this over-hasty jump.\nA Race of Cooks\nA significant step on the way to the top was the domestication of fire.\nSome human species may have made occasional use of fire as early as\n800,000 years ago. By about 300,000 years ago, Homo erectus,\nNeanderthals and the forefathers of Homo sapiens were using fire on a\ndaily basis. Humans now had a dependable source of light and warmth,\nand a deadly weapon against prowling lions. Not long afterwards,\nhumans may even have started deliberately to torch their\nneighbourhoods. A carefully managed fire could turn impassable barren\nthickets into prime grasslands teeming with game. In addition, once the\nfire died down, Stone Age entrepreneurs could walk through the\nsmoking remains and harvest charcoaled animals, nuts and tubers.\nBut the best thing fire did was cook. Foods that humans cannot digest\nin their natural forms – such as wheat, rice and potatoes – became\nstaples of our diet thanks to cooking. Fire not only changed food’s\nchemistry, it changed its biology as well. Cooking killed germs and\nparasites that infested food. Humans also had a far easier time chewing\nand digesting old favourites such as fruits, nuts, insects and carrion if"

Whereas chimpanzees spend five hours a day chewing\nraw food, a single hour suffices for people eating cooked food.\nThe advent of cooking enabled humans to eat more kinds of food, to\ndevote less time to eating, and to make do with smaller teeth and shorter\nintestines. Some scholars believe there is a direct link between the\nadvent of cooking, the shortening of the human intestinal track, and the\ngrowth of the human brain. Since long intestines and large brains are\nboth massive energy consumers, it’s hard to have both. By shortening the\nintestines and decreasing their energy consumption, cooking\ninadvertently opened the way to the jumbo brains of Neanderthals and\nSapiens.1\nFire also opened the first significant gulf between man and the other\nanimals. The power of almost all animals depends on their bodies: the\nstrength of their muscles, the size of their teeth, the breadth of their\nwings. Though they may harness winds and currents, they are unable to\ncontrol these natural forces, and are always constrained by their physical\ndesign. Eagles, for example, identify thermal columns rising from the\nground, spread their giant wings and allow the hot air to lift them\nupwards. Yet eagles cannot control the location of the columns, and\ntheir maximum carrying capacity is strictly proportional to their\nwingspan.\nWhen humans domesticated fire, they gained control of an obedient\nand potentially limitless force. Unlike eagles, humans could choose when\nand where to ignite a flame, and they were able to exploit fire for any\nnumber of tasks. Most importantly, the power of fire was not limited by\nthe form, structure or strength of the human body. A single woman with\na flint or fire stick could burn down an entire forest in a matter of hours.\nThe domestication of fire was a sign of things to come.\nOur Brothers’ Keepers\nDespite the benefits of fire, 150,000 years ago humans were still\nmarginal creatures. They could now scare away lions, warm themselves\nduring cold nights, and burn down the occasional forest. Yet counting all\nspecies together, there were still no more than perhaps a million humans"

We don’t know exactly where and when animals that can be\nclassified as Homo sapiens first evolved from some earlier type of\nhumans, but most scientists agree that by 150,000 years ago, East Africa\nwas populated by Sapiens that looked just like us. If one of them turned\nup in a modern morgue, the local pathologist would notice nothing\npeculiar. Thanks to the blessings of fire, they had smaller teeth and jaws\nthan their ancestors, whereas they had massive brains, equal in size to\nours.\nScientists also agree that about 70,000 years ago, Sapiens from East\nAfrica spread into the Arabian peninsula, and from there they quickly\noverran the entire Eurasian landmass.\nWhen Homo sapiens landed in Arabia, most of Eurasia was already\nsettled by other humans. What happened to them? There are two\nconflicting theories. The ‘Interbreeding Theory’ tells a story of attraction,\nsex and mingling. As the African immigrants spread around the world,\nthey bred with other human populations, and people today are the\noutcome of this interbreeding.\nFor example, when Sapiens reached the Middle East and Europe, they\nencountered the Neanderthals. These humans were more muscular than\nSapiens, had larger brains, and were better adapted to cold climes. They\nused tools and fire, were good hunters, and apparently took care of their\nsick and infirm.

Neanderthals are\noften depicted in caricatures as the archetypical brutish and stupid ‘cave\npeople’, but recent evidence has changed their image.\nAccording to the Interbreeding Theory, when Sapiens spread into\nNeanderthal lands, Sapiens bred with Neanderthals until the two\npopulations merged. If this is the case, then today’s Eurasians are not\npure Sapiens. They are a mixture of Sapiens and Neanderthals.

It had firmer archaeological backing, and was more\npolitically correct (scientists had no desire to open up the Pandora’s box\nof racism by claiming significant genetic diversity among modern human\npopulations). But that ended in 2010, when the results of a four-year\neffort to map the Neanderthal genome were published. Geneticists were\nable to collect enough intact Neanderthal DNA from fossils to make a\nbroad comparison between it and the DNA of contemporary humans.\nThe results stunned the scientific community.\nIt turned out that 1–4 per cent of the unique human DNA of modern\npopulations in the Middle East and Europe is Neanderthal DNA. That’s\nnot a huge amount, but it’s significant. A second shock came several\nmonths later, when DNA extracted from the fossilised finger from\nDenisova was mapped. The results proved that up to 6 per cent of the\nunique human DNA of modern Melanesians and Aboriginal Australians is\nDenisovan DNA.\nIf these results are valid – and it’s important to keep in mind that\nfurther research is under way and may either reinforce or modify these\nconclusions – the Interbreeders got at least some things right. But that\ndoesn’t mean that the Replacement Theory is completely wrong. Since\nNeanderthals and Denisovans contributed only a small amount of DNA\nto our present-day genome, it is impossible to speak of a ‘merger’\nbetween Sapiens and other human species. Although differences between\nthem were not large enough to completely prevent fertile intercourse,\nthey were sufficient to make such contacts very rare.\nHow then should we understand the biological relatedness of Sapiens,\nNeanderthals and Denisovans? Clearly, they were not completely\ndifferent species like horses and donkeys. On the other hand, they were\nnot just different populations of the same species, like bulldogs and\nspaniels. Biological reality is not black and white. There are also\nimportant grey areas. Every two species that evolved from a common\nancestor, such as horses and donkeys, were at one time just two\npopulations of the same species, like bulldogs and spaniels.

The first objects that can\nreliably be called art date from this era (see the Stadel lion-man on this\npage), as does the first clear evidence for religion, commerce and social\nstratification.\nMost researchers believe that these unprecedented accomplishments\nwere the product of a revolution in Sapiens’ cognitive abilities.

When the same group heard a recording of the\nsecond call, the lion warning, they quickly scrambled up a tree.

A parrot can say\nanything Albert Einstein could say, as well as mimicking the sounds of\nphones ringing, doors slamming and sirens wailing. Whatever advantage\nEinstein had over a parrot, it wasn’t vocal. What, then, is so special\nabout our language?\nThe most common answer is that our language is amazingly supple.\nWe can connect a limited number of sounds and signs to produce an\ninfinite number of sentences, each with a distinct meaning. We can\nthereby ingest, store and communicate a prodigious amount of\ninformation about the surrounding world. A green monkey can yell to its\ncomrades, ‘Careful!

She can then describe the exact location, including the different\npaths leading to the area. With this information, the members of her\nband can put their heads together and discuss whether they ought to\napproach the river in order to chase away the lion and hunt the bison.\nA second theory agrees that our unique language evolved as a means\nof sharing information about the world. But the most important\ninformation that needed to be conveyed was about humans, not about\nlions and bison. Our language evolved as a way of gossiping. According\nto this theory Homo sapiens is primarily a social animal. Social\ncooperation is our key for survival and reproduction.

Reliable\ninformation about who could be trusted meant that small bands could\nexpand into larger bands, and Sapiens could develop tighter and more\nsophisticated types of cooperation.1\nThe gossip theory might sound like a joke, but numerous studies\nsupport it.

The alpha male usually wins his position not\nbecause he is physically stronger, but because he leads a large and stable\ncoalition. These coalitions play a central part not only during overt\nstruggles for the alpha position, but in almost all day-to-day activities.\nMembers of a coalition spend more time together, share food, and help\none another in times of trouble.\nThere are clear limits to the size of groups that can be formed and\nmaintained in such a way.

The priest exclaimed ‘Hoc est corpus\nmeum!’ (Latin for ‘This is my body!’) and hocus pocus – the bread turned\ninto Christ’s flesh. Seeing that the priest had properly and assiduously\nobserved all the procedures, millions of devout French Catholics behaved\nas if God really existed in the consecrated bread and wine.\nIn the case of Peugeot SA the crucial story was the French legal code,\nas written by the French parliament. According to the French legislators,\nif a certified lawyer followed all the proper liturgy and rituals, wrote all\nthe required spells and oaths on a wonderfully decorated piece of paper,\nand affixed his ornate signature to the bottom of the document, then\nhocus pocus – a new company was incorporated. When in 1896 Armand\nPeugeot wanted to create his company, he paid a lawyer to go through\nall these sacred procedures. Once the lawyer had performed all the right\nrituals and pronounced all the necessary spells and oaths, millions of\nupright French citizens behaved as if the Peugeot company really\nexisted.\nTelling effective stories is not easy. The difficulty lies not in telling the\nstory, but in convincing everyone else to believe it. Much of history\nrevolves around this question: how does one convince millions of people\nto believe particular stories about gods, or nations, or limited liability\ncompanies? Yet when it succeeds, it gives Sapiens immense power,\nbecause it enables millions of strangers to cooperate and work towards\ncommon goals.

I lie when I say that there is a lion near the river when I\nknow perfectly well that there is no lion there. There is nothing special\nabout lies. Green monkeys and chimpanzees can lie. A green monkey, for\nexample, has been observed calling ‘Careful! A lion!’ when there was no\nlion around. This alarm conveniently frightened away a fellow monkey\nwho had just found a banana, leaving the liar all alone to steal the prize\nfor itself.\nUnlike lying, an imagined reality is something that everyone believes\nin, and as long as this communal belief persists, the imagined reality\nexerts force in the world. The sculptor from the Stadel Cave may\nsincerely have believed in the existence of the lion-man guardian spirit.\nSome sorcerers are charlatans, but most sincerely believe in the\nexistence of gods and demons.

No one was\nlying when, in 2011, the UN demanded that the Libyan government\nrespect the human rights of its citizens, even though the UN, Libya and\nhuman rights are all figments of our fertile imaginations.\nEver since the Cognitive Revolution, Sapiens has thus been living in a\ndual reality.

In 1789 the French population switched almost overnight from\nbelieving in the myth of the divine right of kings to believing in the\nmyth of the sovereignty of the people. Consequently,ever since the\nCognitive Revolution Homo sapiens has been able to revise its behaviour\nrapidly in accordance with changing needs. This opened a fast lane of\ncultural evolution, bypassing the traffic jams of genetic evolution.\nSpeeding down this fast lane, Homo sapiens soon far outstripped all other\nhuman and animal species in its ability to cooperate.\nThe behaviour of other social animals is determined to a large extent\nby their genes. DNA is not an autocrat. Animal behaviour is also\ninfluenced by environmental factors and individual quirks. Nevertheless,\nin a given environment, animals of the same species will tend to behave\nin a similar way. Significant changes in social behaviour cannot occur, in\ngeneral, without genetic mutations. For example, common chimpanzees\nhave a genetic tendency to live in hierarchical groups headed by an\nalpha male. Members of a closely related chimpanzee species, bonobos,\nusually live in more egalitarian groups dominated by female alliances.\nFemale common chimpanzees cannot take lessons from their bonobo\nrelatives and stage a feminist revolution. Male chimps cannot gather in a\nconstitutional assembly to abolish the office of alpha male and declare\nthat from here on out all chimps are to be treated as equals. Such\ndramatic changes in behaviour would occur only if something changed\nin the chimpanzees’ DNA.\nFor similar reasons, archaic humans did not initiate any revolutions.\nAs far as we can tell, changes in social patterns, the invention of new\ntechnologies and the settlement of alien habitats resulted from genetic\nmutations and environmental pressures more than from cultural\ninitiatives. This is why it took humans hundreds of thousands of years to\nmake these steps. Two million years ago, genetic mutations resulted in\nthe appearance of a new human species called Homo erectus. Its\nemergence was accompanied by the development of a new stone tool\ntechnology, now recognised as a defining feature of this species. As long\nas Homo erectus did not undergo further genetic alterations, its stone\ntools remained roughly the same – for close to 2 million years!\nIn contrast, ever since the Cognitive Revolution, Sapiens have been"

The existence of such elites goes against the most\nfundamental principles of natural selection, since these dominant\nmembers of society willingly give up procreation. Whereas chimpanzee\nalpha males use their power to have sex with as many females as\npossible – and consequently sire a large proportion of their troop’s young\n– the Catholic alpha male abstains completely from sexual intercourse\nand childcare. This abstinence does not result from unique\nenvironmental conditions such as a severe lack of food or want of\npotential mates. Nor is it the result of some quirky genetic mutation. The\nCatholic Church has survived for centuries, not by passing on a ‘celibacy\ngene’ from one pope to the next, but by passing on the stories of the New\nTestament and of Catholic canon law.\nIn other words, while the behaviour patterns of archaic humans\nremained fixed for tens of thousands of years, Sapiens could transform\ntheir social structures, the nature of their interpersonal relations, their\neconomic activities and a host of other behaviours within a decade or\ntwo.

Trade cannot exist without trust, and it\nis very difficult to trust strangers. The global trade network of today is\nbased on our trust in such fictional entities as the dollar, the Federal\nReserve Bank, and the totemic trademarks of corporations. When two\nstrangers in a tribal society want to trade, they will often establish trust\nby appealing to a common god, mythical ancestor or totem animal.\nIf archaic Sapiens believing in such fictions traded shells and obsidian,\nit stands to reason that they could also have traded information, thus\ncreating a much denser and wider knowledge network than the one that\nserved Neanderthals and other archaic humans.\nHunting techniques provide another illustration of these differences.\nNeanderthals usually hunted alone or in small groups. Sapiens, on the\nother hand, developed techniques that relied on cooperation between\nmany dozens of individuals, and perhaps even between different bands.\nOne particularly effective method was to surround an entire herd of\nanimals, such as wild horses, then chase them into a narrow gorge,\nwhere it was easy to slaughter them en masse. If all went according to\nplan, the bands could harvest tons of meat, fat and animal skins in a\nsingle afternoon of collective effort, and either consume these riches in a\ngiant potlatch, or dry, smoke or (in Arctic areas) freeze them for later\nusage.

The instinct to gorge\non high-calorie food was hard-wired into our genes.

That’s what makes us spoon\ndown an entire tub of Ben & Jerry’s when we find one in the freezer and\nwash it down with a jumbo Coke.\nThis ‘gorging gene’ theory is widely accepted. Other theories are far\nmore contentious. For example, some evolutionary psychologists argue\nthat ancient foraging bands were not composed of nuclear families\ncentred on monogamous couples. Rather, foragers lived in communes\ndevoid of private property, monogamous relationships and even\nfatherhood.

One good\nexample is the huge variety the first European settlers found among the\nAborigine peoples of Australia. Just before the British conquest, between\n300,000 and 700,000 hunter-gatherers lived on the continent in 200–\n600 tribes, each of which was further divided into several bands.2 Each\ntribe had its own language, religion, norms and customs.

These clans bonded\ntogether into tribes on a strictly territorial basis. In contrast, some tribes\nin northern Australia gave more importance to a person’s maternal\nancestry, and a person’s tribal identity depended on his or her totem\nrather than his territory.\nIt stands to reason that the ethnic and cultural variety among ancient\nhunter-gatherers was equally impressive, and that the 5 million to 8\nmillion foragers who populated the world on the eve of the Agricultural\nRevolution were divided into thousands of separate tribes with\nthousands of different languages and cultures.3 This, after all, was one of\nthe main legacies of the Cognitive Revolution.

With the passing of\ngenerations, the two species co-evolved to communicate well with each\nother. Dogs that were most attentive to the needs and feelings of their\nhuman companions got extra care and food, and were more likely to\nsurvive. Simultaneously, dogs learned to manipulate people for their\nown needs. A 15,000-year bond has yielded a much deeper\nunderstanding and affection between humans and dogs than between\nhumans and any other animal.4 In some cases dead dogs were even\nburied ceremoniously, much like humans.\nMembers of a band knew each other very intimately, and were\nsurrounded throughout their lives by friends and relatives. Loneliness\nand privacy were rare. Neighbouring bands probably competed for\nresources and even fought one another, but they also had friendly\ncontacts. They exchanged members, hunted together, traded rare\nluxuries, cemented political alliances and celebrated religious festivals.\nSuch cooperation was one of the important trademarks of Homo sapiens,\nand gave it a crucial edge over other human species. Sometimes relations\nwith neighbouring bands were tight enough that together they\nconstituted a single tribe, sharing a common language, common myths,\nand common norms and values.\nYet we should not overestimate the importance of such external\nrelations. Even if in times of crisis neighbouring bands drew closer\ntogether, and even if they occasionally gathered to hunt or feast\ntogether, they still spent the vast majority of their time in complete\nisolation and independence. Trade was mostly limited to prestige items\nsuch as shells, amber and pigments. There is no evidence that people\ntraded staple goods like fruits and meat, or that the existence of one\nband depended on the importing of goods from another. Sociopolitical\nrelations, too, tended to be sporadic. The tribe did not serve as a\npermanent political framework, and even if it had seasonal meeting\nplaces, there were no permanent towns or institutions.

Techniques\nfor drying, smoking and freezing food also made it possible to stay put\nfor longer periods. Most importantly, alongside seas and rivers rich in\nseafood and waterfowl, humans set up permanent fishing villages – the\nfirst permanent settlements in history, long predating the Agricultural\nRevolution. Fishing villages might have appeared on the coasts of\nIndonesian islands as early as 45,000 years ago. These may have been\nthe base from which Homo sapiens launched its first transoceanic\nenterprise: the invasion of Australia.\nIn most habitats, Sapiens bands fed themselves in an elastic and\nopportunistic fashion. They scrounged for termites, picked berries, dug\nfor roots, stalked rabbits and hunted bison and mammoth.\nNotwithstanding the popular image of ‘man the hunter’, gathering was\nSapiens’ main activity, and it provided most of their calories, as well as\nraw materials such as flint, wood and bamboo.\nSapiens did not forage only for food and materials. They foraged for\nknowledge as well. To survive, they needed a detailed mental map of\ntheir territory. To maximise the efficiency of their daily search for food,\nthey required information about the growth patterns of each plant and\nthe habits of each animal. They needed to know which foods were\nnourishing, which made you sick, and how to use others as cures. They\nneeded to know the progress of the seasons and what warning signs\npreceded a thunderstorm or a dry spell. They studied every stream,\nevery walnut tree, every bear cave, and every flint-stone deposit in their\nvicinity. Each individual had to understand how to make a stone knife,\nhow to mend a torn cloak, how to lay a rabbit trap, and how to face\navalanches, snakebites or hungry lions. Mastery of each of these many\nskills required years of apprenticeship and practice. The average ancient\nforager could turn a flint stone into a spear point within minutes.

They hunt only one day out\nof three, and gathering takes up just three to six hours daily. In normal\ntimes, this is enough to feed the band. It may well be that ancient\nhunter-gatherers living in zones more fertile than the Kalahari spent\neven less time obtaining food and raw materials. On top of that, foragers\nenjoyed a lighter load of household chores. They had no dishes to wash,\nno carpets to vacuum, no floors to polish, no nappies to change and no\nbills to pay.\nThe forager economy provided most people with more interesting lives\nthan agriculture or industry do.

Farmers tend to eat a very\nlimited and unbalanced diet. Especially in premodern times, most of the\ncalories feeding an agricultural population came from a single crop –\nsuch as wheat, potatoes or rice – that lacks some of the vitamins,\nminerals and other nutritional materials humans need. The typical\npeasant in traditional China ate rice for breakfast, rice for lunch, and\nrice for dinner. If she were lucky, she could expect to eat the same on\nthe following day. By contrast, ancient foragers regularly ate dozens of\ndifferent foodstuffs. The peasant’s ancient ancestor, the forager, may\nhave eaten berries and mushrooms for breakfast; fruits, snails and turtle\nfor lunch; and rabbit steak with wild onions for dinner. Tomorrows\nmenu might have been completely different. This variety ensured that\nthe ancient foragers received all the necessary nutrients.\nFurthermore, by not being dependent on any single kind of food, they\nwere less liable to suffer when one particular food source failed.\nAgricultural societies are ravaged by famine when drought, fire or\nearthquake devastates the annual rice or potato crop. Forager societies\nwere hardly immune to natural disasters, and suffered from periods of\nwant and hunger, but they were usually able to deal with such\ncalamities more easily. If they lost some of their staple foodstuffs, they\ncould gather or hunt other species, or move to a less affected area.\nAncient foragers also suffered less from infectious diseases. Most of the\ninfectious diseases that have plagued agricultural and industrial societies\n(such as smallpox, measles and tuberculosis) originated in domesticated\nanimals and were transferred to humans only after the Agricultural\nRevolution. Ancient foragers, who had domesticated only dogs, were free\nof these scourges. Moreover, most people in agricultural and industrial\nsocieties lived in dense, unhygienic permanent settlements – ideal\nhotbeds for disease.

Most people probably enjoyed the close intimacy of the\nroaming band, but those unfortunates who incurred the hostility or\nmockery of their fellow band members probably suffered terribly.\nModern foragers occasionally abandon and even kill old or disabled\npeople who cannot keep up with the band. Unwanted babies and\nchildren may be slain, and there are even cases of religiously inspired\nhuman sacrifice.\nThe Aché people, hunter-gatherers who lived in the jungles of\nParaguay until the 1960s, offer a glimpse into the darker side of\nforaging. When a valued band member died, the Aché customarily killed\na little girl and buried the two together. Anthropologists who\ninterviewed the Aché recorded a case in which a band abandoned a\nmiddle-aged man who fell sick and was unable to keep up with the\nothers. He was left under a tree. Vultures perched above him, expecting\na hearty meal. But the man recuperated, and, walking briskly, he\nmanaged to rejoin the band. His body was covered with the birds’ faeces,\nso he was henceforth nicknamed ‘Vulture Droppings’.\nWhen an old Aché woman became a burden to the rest of the band,\none of the younger men would sneak behind her and kill her with an\naxe-blow to the head. An Aché man told the inquisitive anthropologists\nstories of his prime years in the jungle. ‘I customarily killed old women.\nI used to kill my aunts … The women were afraid of me … Now, here\nwith the whites, I have become weak.’ Babies born without hair, who\nwere considered underdeveloped, were killed immediately. One woman\nrecalled that her first baby girl was killed because the men in the band\ndid not want another girl. On another occasion a man killed a small boy\nbecause he was ‘in a bad mood and the child was crying’. Another child\nwas buried alive because ‘it was funny-looking and the other children\nlaughed at it’.7\nWe should be careful, though, not to judge the Aché too quickly.\nAnthropologists who lived with them for years report that violence\nbetween adults was very rare.

It should also be noted that the Aché were\nhunted and killed without mercy by Paraguayan farmers. The need to\nevade their enemies probably caused the Aché to adopt an exceptionally\nharsh attitude towards anyone who might become a liability to the band.\nThe truth is that Aché society, like every human society, was very\ncomplex. We should beware of demonising or idealising it on the basis of\na superficial acquaintance. The Aché were neither angels nor fiends –\nthey were humans. So, too, were the ancient hunter-gatherers.\nTalking Ghosts\nWhat can we say about the spiritual and mental life of the ancient\nhunter-gatherers? The basics of the forager economy can be\nreconstructed with some confidence based on quantifiable and objective\nfactors. For example, we can calculate how many calories per day a\nperson needed in order to survive, how many calories were obtained\nfrom a kilogram of walnuts, and how many walnuts could be gathered\nfrom a square kilometre of forest. With this data, we can make an\neducated guess about the relative importance of walnuts in their diet.\nBut did they consider walnuts a delicacy or a humdrum staple? Did\nthey believe that walnut trees were inhabited by spirits? Did they find\nwalnut leaves pretty? If a forager boy wanted to take a forager girl to a\nromantic spot, did the shade of a walnut tree suffice? The world of\nthought, belief and feeling is by definition far more difficult to decipher.\nMost scholars agree that animistic beliefs were common among\nancient foragers. Animism (from ‘anima’, ‘soul’ or ‘spirit’ in Latin) is the\nbelief that almost every place, every animal, every plant and every\nnatural phenomenon has awareness and feelings, and can communicate\ndirectly with humans.

In the animist world, objects and\nliving things are not the only animated beings. There are also immaterial\nentities – the spirits of the dead, and friendly and malevolent beings, the\nkind that we today call demons, fairies and angels.\nAnimists believe that there is no barrier between humans and other\nbeings. They can all communicate directly through speech, song, dance\nand ceremony. A hunter may address a herd of deer and ask that one of\nthem sacrifice itself. If the hunt succeeds, the hunter may ask the dead\nanimal to forgive him. When someone falls sick, a shaman can contact\nthe spirit that caused the sickness and try to pacify it or scare it away. If\nneed be, the shaman may ask for help from other spirits. What\ncharacterises all these acts of communication is that the entities being\naddressed are local beings. They are not universal gods, but rather a\nparticular deer, a particular tree, a particular stream, a particular ghost.\nJust as there is no barrier between humans and other beings, neither is\nthere a strict hierarchy. Non-human entities do not exist merely to\nprovide for the needs of man. Nor are they all-powerful gods who run\nthe world as they wish. The world does not revolve around humans or\naround any other particular group of beings.\nAnimism is not a specific religion. It is a generic name for thousands\nof very different religions, cults and beliefs. What makes all of them\n‘animist’ is this common approach to the world and to man’s place in it.\nSaying that ancient foragers were probably animists is like saying that\npremodern agriculturists were mostly theists. Theism (from ‘theos’, ‘god’\nin Greek) is the view that the universal order is based on a hierarchical\nrelationship between humans and a small group of ethereal entities\ncalled gods. It is certainly true to say that premodern agriculturists\ntended to be theists, but it does not teach us much about the particulars.\nThe generic rubric ‘theists’ covers Jewish rabbis from eighteenth-century\nPoland, witch-burning Puritans from seventeenth-century Massachusetts,"

Any\nattempt to describe the specifics of archaic spirituality is highly\nspeculative, as there is next to no evidence to go by and the little\nevidence we have – a handful of artefacts and cave paintings – can be\ninterpreted in myriad ways.

Perhaps they were the\nchildren of the leader, in a culture that believed in either family\ncharisma or strict rules of succession. According to a second theory, the\nchildren had been identified at birth as the incarnations of some long-\ndead spirits.

Other scholars maintain that the world of the ancient foragers\nwas exceptionally cruel and violent. Both schools of thought are castles\nin the air, connected to the ground by the thin strings of meagre\narchaeological remains and anthropological observations of present-day\nforagers.\nThe anthropological evidence is intriguing but very problematic.\nForagers today live mainly in isolated and inhospitable areas such as the\nArctic or the Kalahari, where population density is very low and\nopportunities to fight other people are limited.

It\nis debatable, however, whether this represents a ‘timeless’ condition or\nthe impact of European imperialism.\nThe archaeological findings are both scarce and opaque. What telltale\nclues might remain of any war that took place tens of thousands of years\nago? There were no fortifications and walls back then, no artillery shells\nor even swords and shields. An ancient spear point might have been used\nin war, but it could have been used in a hunt as well. Fossilised human\nbones are no less hard to interpret. A fracture might indicate a war\nwound or an accident. Nor is the absence of fractures and cuts on an\nancient skeleton conclusive proof that the person to whom the skeleton\nbelonged did not die a violent death. Death can be caused by trauma to\nsoft tissues that leaves no marks on bone. Even more importantly, during\npre-industrial warfare more than 90 per cent of war dead were killed by\nstarvation, cold and disease rather than by weapons. Imagine that\n30,000 years ago one tribe defeated its neighbour and expelled it from\ncoveted foraging grounds. In the decisive battle, ten members of the\ndefeated tribe were killed. In the following year, another hundred\nmembers of the losing tribe died from starvation, cold and disease.\nArchaeologists who come across these no skeletons may too easily\nconclude that most fell victim to some natural disaster.

If this revelation is typical, the ancient\nDanube Valley was as violent as the twentieth century.*\nThe depressing findings from the Danube Valley are supported by a\nstring of equally depressing findings from other areas. At Jabl Sahaba in\nSudan, a 12,000-year-old cemetery containing fifty-nine skeletons was\ndiscovered. Arrowheads and spear points were found embedded in or\nlying near the bones of twenty-four skeletons, 40 per cent of the find.\nThe skeleton of one woman revealed twelve injuries. In Ofnet Cave in\nBavaria, archaeologists discovered the remains of thirty-eight foragers,\nmainly women and children, who had been thrown into two burial pits.\nHalf the skeletons, including those of children and babies, bore clear\nsigns of damage by human weapons such as clubs and knives. The few\nskeletons belonging to mature males bore the worst marks of violence.

Yet they were unable to venture into the open sea,\nand none reached America, Australia, or remote islands such as\nMadagascar, New Zealand and Hawaii.\nThe sea barrier prevented not just humans but also many other Afro-\nAsian animals and plants from reaching this ‘Outer World’. As a result,\nthe organisms of distant lands like Australia and Madagascar evolved in\nisolation for millions upon millions of years, taking on shapes and\nnatures very different from those of their distant Afro-Asian relatives.\nPlanet Earth was separated into several distinct ecosystems, each made\nup of a unique assembly of animals and plants.

It’s hard to see how the new\nweather patterns alone could have caused such a massive extinction. It’s\ncommon today to explain anything and everything as the result of\nclimate change, but the truth is that earth’s climate never rests. It is in\nconstant flux. Every event in history occurred against the background of\nsome climate change.\nIn particular, our planet has experienced numerous cycles of cooling\nand warming. During the last million years, there has been an ice age on\naverage every 100,000 years. The last one ran from about 75,000 to\n15,000 years ago. Not unusually severe for an ice age, it had twin peaks,\nthe first about 70,000 years ago and the second at about 20,000 years\nago. The giant diprotodon appeared in Australia more than 1.5 million\nyears ago and successfully weathered at least ten previous ice ages. It\nalso survived the first peak of the last ice age, around 70,000 years ago.\nWhy, then, did it disappear 45,000 years ago? Of course, if diprotodons\nhad been the only large animal to disappear at this time, it might have\nbeen just a fluke. But more than 90 per cent of Australia’s megafauna\ndisappeared along with the diprotodon. The evidence is circumstantial,\nbut it’s hard to imagine that Sapiens, just by coincidence, arrived in\nAustralia at the precise point that all these animals were dropping dead\nof the chills.3\nSecondly, when climate change causes mass extinctions, sea creatures\nare usually hit as hard as land dwellers. Yet there is no evidence of any\nsignificant disappearance of oceanic fauna 45,000 years ago. Human\ninvolvement can easily explain why the wave of extinction obliterated\nthe terrestrial megafauna of Australia while sparing that of the nearby\noceans. Despite its burgeoning navigational abilities, Homo sapiens was\nstill overwhelmingly a terrestrial menace.\nThirdly, mass extinctions akin to the archetypal Australian decimation\noccurred again and again in the ensuing millennia – whenever people\nsettled another part of the Outer World. In these cases Sapiens guilt is\nirrefutable. For example, the megafauna of New Zealand – which had\nweathered the alleged ‘climate change’ of c.45,000 years ago without a\nscratch – suffered devastating blows immediately after the first humans\nset foot on the islands.

Within a couple of\ncenturies, the majority of the local megafauna was extinct, along with 60\nper cent of all bird species.\nA similar fate befell the mammoth population of Wrangel Island in the\nArctic Ocean (200 kilometres north of the Siberian coast). Mammoths\nhad flourished for millions of years over most of the northern\nhemisphere, but as Homo sapiens spread – first over Eurasia and then\nover North America – the mammoths retreated. By 10,000 years ago\nthere was not a single mammoth to be found in the world, except on a\nfew remote Arctic islands, most conspicuously Wrangel. The mammoths\nof Wrangel continued to prosper for a few more millennia, then suddenly\ndisappeared about 4,000 years ago, just when the first humans reached\nthe island.\nWere the Australian extinction an isolated event, we could grant\nhumans the benefit of the doubt. But the historical record makes Homo\nsapiens look like an ecological serial killer.\nAll the settlers of Australia had at their disposal was Stone Age\ntechnology. How could they cause an ecological disaster? There are\nthree explanations that mesh quite nicely.\nLarge animals – the primary victims of the Australian extinction –\nbreed slowly. Pregnancy is long, offspring per pregnancy are few, and\nthere are long breaks between pregnancies. Consequently, if humans cut\ndown even one diprotodon every few months, it would be enough to\ncause diprotodon deaths to outnumber births. Within a few thousand\nyears the last, lonesome diprotodon would pass away, and with her the\nentire species.4\nIn fact, for all their size, diprotodons and Australia’s other giants\nprobably wouldn’t have been that hard to hunt because they would have\nbeen taken totally by surprise by their two-legged assailants. Various\nhuman species had been prowling and evolving in Afro-Asia for 2\nmillion years. They slowly honed their hunting skills, and began going\nafter large animals around 400,000 years ago. The big beasts of Africa\nand Asia learned to avoid humans, so when the new mega-predator –\nHomo sapiens – appeared on the Afro-Asian scene, the large animals\nalready knew to keep their distance from creatures that looked like it.

They don’t have long, sharp\nteeth or muscular, lithe bodies. So when a diprotodon, the largest\nmarsupial ever to walk the earth, set eyes for the first time on this frail-\nlooking ape, he gave it one glance and then went back to chewing\nleaves. These animals had to evolve a fear of humankind, but before they\ncould do so they were gone.\nThe second explanation is that by the time Sapiens reached Australia,\nthey had already mastered fire agriculture. Faced with an alien and\nthreatening environment, they deliberately burned vast areas of\nimpassable thickets and dense forests to create open grasslands, which\nattracted more easily hunted game, and were better suited to their\nneeds. They thereby completely changed the ecology of large parts of\nAustralia within a few short millennia.\nOne body of evidence supporting this view is the fossil plant record.\nEucalyptus trees were rare in Australia 45,000 years ago. But the arrival\nof Homo sapiens inaugurated a golden age for the species. Since\neucalyptuses are particularly resistant to fire, they spread far and wide\nwhile other trees and shrubs disappeared.\nThese changes in vegetation influenced the animals that ate the plants\nand the carnivores that ate the vegetarians. Koalas, which subsist\nexclusively on eucalyptus leaves, happily munched their way into new\nterritories. Most other animals suffered greatly. Many Australian food\nchains collapsed, driving the weakest links into extinction.5\nA third explanation agrees that hunting and fire agriculture played a\nsignificant role in the extinction, but emphasises that we can’t\ncompletely ignore the role of climate. The climate changes that beset\nAustralia about 45,000 years ago destabilised the ecosystem and made it\nparticularly vulnerable. Under normal circumstances the system would\nprobably have recuperated, as had happened many times previously.\nHowever, humans appeared on the stage at just this critical juncture and\npushed the brittle ecosystem into the abyss. The combination of climate\nchange and human hunting is particularly devastating for large animals,\nsince it attacks them from different angles. It is hard to find a good\nsurvival strategy that will work simultaneously against multiple threats.\nWithout further evidence, there’s no way of deciding between the\nthree scenarios.

South Americans learned how to raise potatoes and llamas,\nunaware of what was going on in either Mexico or the Levant. Chinas\nfirst revolutionaries domesticated rice, millet and pigs. North America’s\nfirst gardeners were those who got tired of combing the undergrowth for\nedible gourds and decided to cultivate pumpkins. New Guineans tamed\nsugar cane and bananas, while the first West African farmers made\nAfrican millet, African rice, sorghum and wheat conform to their needs.\nFrom these initial focal points, agriculture spread far and wide. By the\nfirst century the vast majority of people throughout most of the world\nAD\nwere agriculturists.\nWhy did agricultural revolutions erupt in the Middle East, China and\nCentral America but not in Australia, Alaska or South Africa? The reason\nis simple: most species of plants and animals can’t be domesticated.\nSapiens could dig up delicious truffles and hunt down woolly\nmammoths, but domesticating either species was out of the question.\nThe fungi were far too elusive, the giant beasts too ferocious. Of the\nthousands of species that our ancestors hunted and gathered, only a few\nwere suitable candidates for farming and herding. Those few species\nlived in particular places, and those are the places where agricultural\nrevolutions occurred.\nScholars once proclaimed that the agricultural revolution was a great\nleap forward for humanity.

The\nculprits were a handful of plant species, including wheat, rice and\npotatoes. These plants domesticated Homo sapiens, rather than vice\nversa.\nThink for a moment about the Agricultural Revolution from the\nviewpoint of wheat. Ten thousand years ago wheat was just a wild grass,\none of many, confined to a small range in the Middle East. Suddenly,\nwithin just a few short millennia, it was growing all over the world.\nAccording to the basic evolutionary criteria of survival and reproduction,\nwheat has become one of the most successful plants in the history of the\nearth. In areas such as the Great Plains of North America, where not a\nsingle wheat stalk grew 10,000 years ago, you can today walk for\nhundreds upon hundreds of kilometres without encountering any other\nplant. Worldwide, wheat covers about 2.25 million square kilometres of\nthe globes surface, almost ten times the size of Britain. How did this\ngrass turn from insignificant to ubiquitous?\nWheat did it by manipulating Homo sapiens to its advantage. This ape\nhad been living a fairly comfortable life hunting and gathering until\nabout 10,000 years ago, but then began to invest more and more effort\nin cultivating wheat. Within a couple of millennia, humans in many\nparts of the world were doing little from dawn to dusk other than taking\ncare of wheat plants. It wasn’t easy. Wheat demanded a lot of them.\nWheat didn’t like rocks and pebbles, so Sapiens broke their backs\nclearing fields. Wheat didn’t like sharing its space, water and nutrients\nwith other plants, so men and women laboured long days weeding under\nthe scorching sun. Wheat got sick, so Sapiens had to keep a watch out\nfor worms and blight. Wheat was defenceless against other organisms\nthat liked to eat it, from rabbits to locust swarms, so the farmers had to\nguard and protect it. Wheat was thirsty, so humans lugged water from\nsprings and streams to water it. Its hunger even impelled Sapiens to\ncollect animal faeces to nourish the ground in which wheat grew.\nThe body of Homo sapiens had not evolved for such tasks. It was\nadapted to climbing apple trees and running after gazelles, not to\nclearing rocks and carrying water buckets. Human spines, knees, necks\nand arches paid the price.

Moreover, the new agricultural tasks\ndemanded so much time that people were forced to settle permanently\nnext to their wheat fields. This completely changed their way of life. We\ndid not domesticate wheat. It domesticated us. The word ‘domesticate’\ncomes from the Latin domus, which means ‘house’. Who’s the one living\nin a house? Not the wheat. It’s the Sapiens.\nHow did wheat convince Homo sapiens to exchange a rather good life\nfor a more miserable existence? What did it offer in return? It did not\noffer a better diet. Remember, humans are omnivorous apes who thrive\non a wide variety of foods. Grains made up only a small fraction of the\nhuman diet before the Agricultural Revolution. A diet based on cereals is\npoor in minerals and vitamins, hard to digest, and really bad for your\nteeth and gums.\nWheat did not give people economic security. The life of a peasant is\nless secure than that of a hunter-gatherer. Foragers relied on dozens of\nspecies to survive, and could therefore weather difficult years even\nwithout stocks of preserved food. If the availability of one species was\nreduced, they could gather and hunt more of other species. Farming\nsocieties have, until very recently, relied for the great bulk of their\ncalorie intake on a small variety of domesticated plants. In many areas,\nthey relied on just a single staple, such as wheat, potatoes or rice. If the\nrains failed or clouds of locusts arrived or if a fungus learned how to\ninfect that staple species, peasants died by the thousands and millions.\nNor could wheat offer security against human violence. The early\nfarmers were at least as violent as their forager ancestors, if not more so.\nFarmers had more possessions and needed land for planting. The loss of\npasture land to raiding neighbours could mean the difference between\nsubsistence and starvation, so there was much less room for compromise.\nWhen a foraging band was hard-pressed by a stronger rival, it could\nusually move on. It was difficult and dangerous, but it was feasible.\nWhen a strong enemy threatened an agricultural village, retreat meant\ngiving up fields, houses and granaries. In many cases, this doomed the\nrefugees to starvation. Farmers, therefore, tended to stay put and fight to\nthe bitter end."

Would she say ‘I am dying from\nmalnutrition, but in 2,000 years, people will have plenty to eat and live\nin big air-conditioned houses, so my suffering is a worthwhile sacrifice’?\nWhat then did wheat offer agriculturists, including that malnourished\nChinese girl?

A band of Homo sapiens gathering mushrooms and nuts and\nhunting deer and rabbit did not all of a sudden settle in a permanent\nvillage, ploughing fields, sowing wheat and carrying water from the\nriver. The change proceeded by stages, each of which involved just a\nsmall alteration in daily life.\nHomo sapiens reached the Middle East around 70,000 years ago. For\nthe next 50,000 years our ancestors flourished there without agriculture.\nThe natural resources of the area were enough to support its human\npopulation. In times of plenty people had a few more children, and in\ntimes of need a few less. Humans, like many mammals, have hormonal\nand genetic mechanisms that help control procreation. In good times\nfemales reach puberty earlier, and their chances of getting pregnant are\na bit higher. In bad times puberty is late and fertility decreases.\nTo these natural population controls were added cultural mechanisms.\nBabies and small children, who move slowly and demand much\nattention, were a burden on nomadic foragers. People tried to space\ntheir children three to four years apart. Women did so by nursing their\nchildren around the clock and until a late age (around-the-clock suckling\nsignificantly decreases the chances of getting pregnant). Other methods\nincluded full or partial sexual abstinence (backed perhaps by cultural\ntaboos), abortions and occasionally infanticide.4\nDuring these long millennia people occasionally ate wheat grain, but\nthis was a marginal part of their diet. About 18,000 years ago, the last\nice age gave way to a period of global warming. As temperatures rose, so\ndid rainfall. The new climate was ideal for Middle Eastern wheat and\nother cereals, which multiplied and spread. People began eating more\nwheat, and in exchange they inadvertently spread its growth. Since it\nwas impossible to eat wild grains without first winnowing, grinding and\ncooking them, people who gathered these grains carried them back to\ntheir temporary campsites for processing. Wheat grains are small and\nnumerous, so some of them inevitably fell on the way to the campsite\nand were lost. Over time, more and more wheat grew along favourite\nhuman trails and near campsites.\nWhen humans burned down forests and thickets, this also helped\nwheat.

A\ngeneration later, as wheat plants multiplied and spread, the harvest\ncamp might have lasted for five weeks, then six, and finally it became a\npermanent village. Evidence of such settlements has been discovered\nthroughout the Middle East, particularly in the Levant, where the\nNatufian culture flourished from 12,500 to 9500 . The Natufians\nBC BC\nwere hunter-gatherers who subsisted on dozens of wild species, but they\nlived in permanent villages and devoted much of their time to the\nintensive gathering and processing of wild cereals. They built stone\nhouses and granaries. They stored grain for times of need. They invented\nnew tools such as stone scythes for harvesting wild wheat, and stone\npestles and mortars to grind it.\nIn the years following 9500 , the descendants of the Natufians\nBC\ncontinued to gather and process cereals, but they also began to cultivate\nthem in more and more elaborate ways. When gathering wild grains,\nthey took care to lay aside part of the harvest to sow the fields next\nseason. They discovered that they could achieve much better results by\nsowing the grains deep in the ground rather than haphazardly scattering\nthem on the surface. So they began to hoe and plough.

Another deal was struck concerning the fate of\nanimals such as sheep, goats, pigs and chickens. Nomadic bands that\nstalked wild sheep gradually altered the constitutions of the herds on\nwhich they preyed. This process probably began with selective hunting.\nHumans learned that it was to their advantage to hunt only adult rams\nand old or sick sheep. They spared fertile females and young lambs in\norder to safeguard the long-term vitality of the local herd. The second\nstep might have been to actively defend the herd against predators,\ndriving away lions, wolves and rival human bands. The band might next\nhave corralled the herd into a narrow gorge in order to better control\nand defend it. Finally, people began to make a more careful selection\namong the sheep in order to tailor them to human needs. The most\naggressive rams, those that showed the greatest resistance to human\ncontrol, were slaughtered first. So were the skinniest and most\ninquisitive females. (Shepherds are not fond of sheep whose curiosity\ntakes them far from the herd.) With each passing generation, the sheep\nbecame fatter, more submissive and less curious. Voilà! Mary had a little\nlamb and everywhere that Mary went the lamb was sure to go.\nAlternatively, hunters may have caught and adopted’ a lamb, fattening\nit during the months of plenty and slaughtering it in the leaner season.\nAt some stage they began keeping a greater number of such lambs. Some\nof these reached puberty and began to procreate. The most aggressive\nand unruly lambs were first to the slaughter. The most submissive, most\nappealing lambs were allowed to live longer and procreate. The result\nwas a herd of domesticated and submissive sheep.\nSuch domesticated animals – sheep, chickens, donkeys and others –\nsupplied food (meat, milk, eggs), raw materials (skins, wool), and muscle\npower. Transportation, ploughing, grinding and other tasks, hitherto\nperformed by human sinew, were increasingly carried out by animals.

To\ncontinue a supply of animal milk, a farmer needs to have calves, kids or\nlambs for suckling, but must prevent them from monopolising the milk.\nOne common method throughout history was to simply slaughter the\ncalves and kids shortly after birth, milk the mother for all she was\nworth, and then get her pregnant again. This is still a very widespread\ntechnique. In many modern dairy farms a milk cow usually lives for\nabout five years before being slaughtered. During these five years she is\nalmost constantly pregnant, and is fertilised within 60 to 120 days after\ngiving birth in order to preserve maximum milk production. Her calves\nare separated from her shortly after birth. The females are reared to\nbecome the next generation of dairy cows, whereas the males are\nhanded over to the care of the meat industry.8\nAnother method is to keep the calves and kids near their mothers, but\nprevent them by various stratagems from suckling too much milk. The\nsimplest way to do that is to allow the kid or calf to start suckling, but\ndrive it away once the milk starts flowing. This method usually\nencounters resistance from both kid and mother. Some shepherd tribes\nused to kill the offspring, eat its flesh, and then stuff the skin. The\nstuffed offspring was then presented to the mother so that its presence\nwould encourage her milk production. The Nuer tribe in the Sudan went\nso far as to smear stuffed animals with their mother’s urine, to give the\ncounterfeit calves a familiar, live scent. Another Nuer technique was to\ntie a ring of thorns around a calf’s mouth, so that it pricks the mother\nand causes her to resist suckling.9 Tuareg camel breeders in the Sahara\nused to puncture or cut off parts of the nose and upper lip of young\ncamels in order to make suckling painful, thereby discouraging them\nfrom consuming too much milk.10\nNot all agricultural societies were this cruel to their farm animals. The\nlives of some domesticated animals could be quite good. Sheep raised for\nwool, pet dogs and cats, war horses and race horses often enjoyed\ncomfortable conditions.

They cut\ndown forests, dug canals, cleared fields, built houses, ploughed furrows,\nand planted fruit trees in tidy rows. The resulting artificial habitat was\nmeant only for humans and ‘their’ plants and animals, and was often\nfenced off by walls and hedges.

Foragers\nusually didn’t waste much time thinking about next week or next month.\nFarmers sailed in their imagination years and decades into the future.\nForagers discounted the future because they lived from hand to mouth\nand could only preserve food or accumulate possessions with difficulty.\nOf course, they clearly engaged in some advanced planning. The creators\nof the cave paintings of Chauvet, Lascaux and Altamira almost certainly\nintended them to last for generations. Social alliances and political\nrivalries were long-term affairs. It often took years to repay a favour or\nto avenge a wrong. Nevertheless, in the subsistence economy of hunting\nand gathering, there was an obvious limit to such long-term planning.\nParadoxically, it saved foragers a lot of anxieties. There was no sense in\nworrying about things that they could not influence.\nThe Agricultural Revolution made the future far more important than\nit had ever been before. Farmers must always keep the future in mind\nand must work in its service. The agricultural economy was based on a\nseasonal cycle of production, comprising long months of cultivation\nfollowed by short peak periods of harvest. On the night following the\nend of a plentiful harvest the peasants might celebrate for all they were\nworth, but within a week or so they were again up at dawn for a long\nday in the field. Although there was enough food for today, next week,\nand even next month, they had to worry about next year and the year\nafter that.\nConcern about the future was rooted not only in seasonal cycles of\nproduction, but also in the fundamental uncertainty of agriculture. Since\nmost villages lived by cultivating a very limited variety of domesticated\nplants and animals, they were at the mercy of droughts, floods and\npestilence. Peasants were obliged to produce more than they consumed\nso that they could build up reserves. Without grain in the silo, jars of\nolive oil in the cellar, cheese in the pantry and sausages hanging from\nthe rafters, they would starve in bad years. And bad years were bound to\ncome, sooner or later. A peasant living on the assumption that bad years\nwould not come didn’t live long.\nConsequently, from the very advent of agriculture, worries about the\nfuture became major players in the theatre of the human mind.

They\nneeded the rivers to rise in order to spread the fertile topsoil washed\ndown from the highlands, and to enable their vast irrigation systems to\nfill with water. But floods that surged too high or came at the wrong\ntime could destroy their fields as much as a drought.\nPeasants were worried about the future not just because they had\nmore cause for worry, but also because they could do something about\nit. They could clear another field, dig another irrigation canal, sow more\ncrops. The anxious peasant was as frenetic and hardworking as a\nharvester ant in the summer, sweating to plant olive trees whose oil\nwould be pressed by his children and grandchildren, putting off until the\nwinter or the following year the eating of the food he craved today.\nThe stress of farming had far-reaching consequences.

It ruled most of Mesopotamia, including the bulk of modern\nIraq and parts of present-day Syria and Iran. The Babylonian king most\nfamous today was Hammurabi. His fame is due primarily to the text that\nbears his name, the Code of Hammurabi. This was a collection of laws\nand judicial decisions whose aim was to present Hammurabi as a role\nmodel of a just king, serve as a basis for a more uniform legal system\nacross the Babylonian Empire, and teach future generations what justice\nis and how a just king acts.\nFuture generations took notice.

Hammurabi’s Code is therefore a good source for understanding\nthe ancient Mesopotamians’ ideal of social order.3\nThe text begins by saying that the gods Anu, Enlil and Marduk – the\nleading deities of the Mesopotamian pantheon – appointed Hammurabi\n‘to make justice prevail in the land, to abolish the wicked and the evil, to\nprevent the strong from oppressing the weak’.4 It then lists about 300\njudgements, given in the set formula ‘If such and such a thing happens,\nsuch is the judgment.’ For example, judgements 196–9 and 209–14 read:\nIf a superior man should blind the eye of another superior man,\n196.\nthey shall blind his eye.\nIf he should break the bone of another superior man, they shall\n197.\nbreak his bone.\nIf he should blind the eye of a commoner or break the bone of a\n198.\ncommoner, he shall weigh and deliver 60 shekels of silver.\nIf he should blind the eye of a slave of a superior man or break\nthe bone of a slave of a superior man, he shall weigh and deliver\n199."

To us it\nmay seem strange that the killer remains unharmed whereas his\ninnocent daughter is killed, but to Hammurabi and the Babylonians this\nseemed perfectly just.

Their society could then produce enough food for\nits members, distribute it efficiently, protect itself against its enemies,\nand expand its territory so as to acquire more wealth and better security.\nAbout 3,500 years after Hammurabi’s death, the inhabitants of\nthirteen British colonies in North America felt that the king of England\nwas treating them unjustly.

So ‘life, liberty, and the pursuit of\nhappiness’ should be translated into ‘life and the pursuit of pleasure’.\nSo here is that line from the American Declaration of Independence\ntranslated into biological terms:\nWe hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men evolved differently, that they are born with\ncertain mutable characteristics, and that among these are life and the pursuit of pleasure.\nAdvocates of equality and human rights may be outraged by this line of\nreasoning. Their response is likely to be, ‘We know that people are not\nequal biologically!

They believe that every human is an individual,\nwhose worth does not depend on what other people think of him or her.\nEach of us has within ourselves a brilliant ray of light that gives value\nand meaning to our lives.

Most people do not wish to\naccept that the order governing their lives is imaginary, but in fact every\nperson is born into a pre-existing imagined order, and his or her desires\nare shaped from birth by its dominant myths. Our personal desires\nthereby become the imagined order’s most important defences.\nFor instance, the most cherished desires of present-day Westerners are\nshaped by romantic, nationalist, capitalist and humanist myths that have\nbeen around for centuries. Friends giving advice often tell each other,\n‘Follow your heart.’ But the heart is a double agent that usually takes its\ninstructions from the dominant myths of the day, and the very\nrecommendation to ‘Follow your heart’ was implanted in our minds by a\ncombination of nineteenth-century Romantic myths and twentieth-\ncentury consumerist myths. The Coca-Cola Company, for example, has\nmarketed Diet Coke around the world under the slogan, ‘Diet Coke. Do\nwhat feels good.’\nEven what people take to be their most personal desires are usually\nprogrammed by the imagined order.

A chimpanzee alpha male would never think of using\nhis power in order to go on holiday into the territory of a neighbouring\nchimpanzee band. The elite of ancient Egypt spent their fortunes\nbuilding pyramids and having their corpses mummified, but none of\nthem thought of going shopping in Babylon or taking a skiing holiday in\nPhoenicia. People today spend a great deal of money on holidays abroad\nbecause they are true believers in the myths of romantic consumerism.\nRomanticism tells us that in order to make the most of our human\npotential we must have as many different experiences as we can. We\nmust open ourselves to a wide spectrum of emotions; we must sample\nvarious kinds of relationships; we must try different cuisines; we must\nlearn to appreciate different styles of music. One of the best ways to do\nall that is to break free from our daily routine, leave behind our familiar\nsetting, and go travelling in distant lands, where we can ‘experience’ the\nculture, the smells, the tastes and the norms of other people.

Every television commercial is another little\nlegend about how consuming some product or service will make life\nbetter.\nRomanticism, which encourages variety, meshes perfectly with\nconsumerism.

It disappears or changes\nif that particular individual changes his or her beliefs. Many a child\nbelieves in the existence of an imaginary friend who is invisible and\ninaudible to the rest of the world.

If a single individual changes his or her beliefs, or even dies,\nit is of little importance. However, if most individuals in the network die\nor change their beliefs, the inter-subjective phenomenon will mutate or\ndisappear.

This\npartial script was composed of ten signs, representing the numbers from\n0 to 9. Confusingly, these signs are known as Arabic numerals even\nthough they were first invented by the Hindus (even more confusingly,\nmodern Arabs use a set of digits that look quite different from Western\nones). But the Arabs get the credit because when they invaded India they\nencountered the system, understood its usefulness, refined it, and spread\nit through the Middle East and then to Europe. When several other signs\nwere later added to the Arab numerals (such as the signs for addition,\nsubtraction and multiplication), the basis of modern mathematical\nnotation came into being.\nAlthough this system of writing remains a partial script, it has become\nthe world’s dominant language. Almost all states, companies,\norganisations and institutions – whether they speak Arabic, Hindi,\nEnglish or Norwegian – use mathematical script to record and process\ndata. Every piece of information that can be translated into\nmathematical script is stored, spread and processed with mind-boggling\nspeed and efficiency.\nA person who wishes to influence the decisions of governments,\norganisations and companies must therefore learn to speak in numbers.\nExperts do their best to translate even ideas such as ‘poverty’, ‘happiness’\nand ‘honesty’ into numbers (‘the poverty line’, ‘subjective well-being\nlevels’, ‘credit rating’).

These two\ninventions filled the gaps left by our biological inheritance.\nHowever, the appearance of these networks was, for many, a dubious\nblessing. The imagined orders sustaining these networks were neither\nneutral nor fair. They divided people into make-believe groups, arranged\nin a hierarchy. The upper levels enjoyed privileges and power, while the\nlower ones suffered from discrimination and oppression.

Slaves got a beating if they complained.\nDespite its proclamation of the equality of all men, the imagined order\nestablished by the Americans in 1776 also established a hierarchy.

Liberty, too, carried\nvery different connotations than it does today. In 1776, it did not mean\nthat the disempowered (certainly not blacks or Indians or, God forbid,\nwomen) could gain and exercise power. It meant simply that the state\ncould not, except in unusual circumstances, confiscate a citizen’s private\nproperty or tell him what to do with it. The American order thereby\nupheld the hierarchy of wealth, which some thought was mandated by\nGod and others viewed as representing the immutable laws of nature.\nNature, it was claimed, rewarded merit with wealth while penalising\nindolence.\nAll the above-mentioned distinctions – between free persons and\nslaves, between whites and blacks, between rich and poor – are rooted in\nfictions. (The hierarchy of men and women will be discussed later.) Yet\nit is an iron rule of history that every imagined hierarchy disavows its\nfictional origins and claims to be natural and inevitable. For instance,\nmany people who have viewed the hierarchy of free persons and slaves\nas natural and correct have argued that slavery is not a human\ninvention.

Why did\ntraditional Indian society classify people according to caste, Ottoman\nsociety according to religion, and American society according to race? In\nmost cases the hierarchy originated as the result of a set of accidental\nhistorical circumstances and was then perpetuated and refined over\nmany generations as different groups developed vested interests in it.\nFor instance, many scholars surmise that the Hindu caste system took\nshape when Indo-Aryan people invaded the Indian subcontinent about\n3,000 years ago, subjugating the local population. The invaders\nestablished a stratified society, in which they – of course – occupied the\nleading positions (priests and warriors), leaving the natives to live as\nservants and slaves. The invaders, who were few in number, feared\nlosing their privileged status and unique identity. To forestall this\ndanger, they divided the population into castes, each of which was\nrequired to pursue a specific occupation or perform a specific role in\nsociety. Each had different legal status, privileges and duties. Mixing of\ncastes – social interaction, marriage, even the sharing of meals – was\nprohibited. And the distinctions were not just legal – they became an\ninherent part of religious mythology and practice.\nThe rulers argued that the caste system reflected an eternal cosmic\nreality rather than a chance historical development. Concepts of purity\nand impurity were essential elements in Hindu religion, and they were\nharnessed to buttress the social pyramid. Pious Hindus were taught that\ncontact with members of a different caste could pollute not only them\npersonally, but society as a whole, and should therefore be abhorred.\nSuch ideas are hardly unique to Hindus. Throughout history, and in\nalmost all societies, concepts of pollution and purity have played a\nleading role in enforcing social and political divisions and have been\nexploited by numerous ruling classes to maintain their privileges. The\nfear of pollution is not a complete fabrication of priests and princes,\nhowever.

Long after the Indo-Aryan invasion\nwas forgotten, Indians continued to believe in the caste system and to\nabhor the pollution caused by caste mixing. Castes were not immune to\nchange. In fact, as time went by, large castes were divided into sub-\ncastes. Eventually the original four castes turned into 3,000 different\ngroupings called jati (literally ‘birth’). But this proliferation of castes did\nnot change the basic principle of the system, according to which every\nperson is born into a particular rank, and any infringement of its rules\npollutes the person and society as a whole. A persons jati determines her\nprofession, the food she can eat, her place of residence and her eligible\nmarriage partners. Usually a person can marry only within his or her\ncaste, and the resulting children inherit that status.\nWhenever a new profession developed or a new group of people\nappeared on the scene, they had to be recognised as a caste in order to\nreceive a legitimate place within Hindu society. Groups that failed to\nwin recognition as a caste were, literally, outcasts – in this stratified\nsociety, they did not even occupy the lowest rung. They became known\nas Untouchables.

It was obviously far easier to buy slaves in an existing\nmarket than to create a new one from scratch.\nThirdly, and most importantly, American plantations in places such as\nVirginia, Haiti and Brazil were plagued by malaria and yellow fever,\nwhich had originated in Africa. Africans had acquired over the\ngenerations a partial genetic immunity to these diseases, whereas\nEuropeans were totally defenceless and died in droves. It was\nconsequently wiser for a plantation owner to invest his money in an\nAfrican slave than in a European slave or indentured labourer.\nParadoxically, genetic superiority (in terms of immunity) translated into\nsocial inferiority: precisely because Africans were fitter in tropical\nclimates than Europeans, they ended up as the slaves of European\nmasters! Due to these circumstantial factors, the burgeoning new\nsocieties of America were to be divided into a ruling caste of white\nEuropeans and a subjugated caste of black Africans.\nBut people don’t like to say that they keep slaves of a certain race or\norigin simply because it’s economically expedient. Like the Aryan\nconquerors of India, white Europeans in the Americas wanted to be seen\nnot only as economically successful but also as pious, just and objective.\nReligious and scientific myths were pressed into service to justify this\ndivision. Theologians argued that Africans descend from Ham, son of\nNoah, saddled by his father with a curse that his offspring would be\nslaves. Biologists argued that blacks are less intelligent than whites and\ntheir moral sense less developed. Doctors alleged that blacks live in filth\nand spread diseases – in other words, they are a source of pollution.\nThese myths struck a chord in American culture, and in Western\nculture generally. They continued to exert their influence long after the\nconditions that created slavery had disappeared. In the early nineteenth\ncentury imperial Britain outlawed slavery and stopped the Atlantic slave\ntrade, and in the decades that followed slavery was gradually outlawed\nthroughout the American continent.

In 1865 the Thirteenth Amendment to the US\nConstitution outlawed slavery and the Fourteenth Amendment mandated\nthat citizenship and the equal protection of the law could not be denied\non the basis of race. However, two centuries of slavery meant that most\nblack families were far poorer and far less educated than most white\nfamilies.

His children, born in the 1880S and 1890s, started life\nwith the same disadvantage – they, too, were born to an uneducated,\npoor family.\nBut economic disadvantage was not the whole story. Alabama was\nalso home to many poor whites who lacked the opportunities available\nto their better-off racial brothers and sisters. In addition, the Industrial\nRevolution and the waves of immigration made the United States an\nextremely fluid society, where rags could quickly turn into riches. If\nmoney was all that mattered, the sharp divide between the races should\nsoon have blurred, not least through intermarriage.\nBut that did not happen. By 1865 whites, as well as many blacks, took\nit to be a simple matter of fact that blacks were less intelligent, more\nviolent and sexually dissolute, lazier and less concerned about personal\ncleanliness than whites.

The ancient Hebrews considered this a\nreasonable arrangement.\nRaping a woman who did not belong to any man was not considered a\ncrime at all, just as picking up a lost coin on a busy street is not\nconsidered theft. And if a husband raped his own wife, he had\ncommitted no crime. In fact, the idea that a husband could rape his wife\nwas an oxymoron. To be a husband was to have full control of your\nwife’s sexuality. To say that a husband ‘raped’ his wife was as illogical as\nsaying that a man stole his own wallet. Such thinking was not confined\nto the ancient Middle East. As of 2006, there were still fifty-three\ncountries where a husband could not be prosecuted for the rape of his\nwife.

They don’t see this as a cultural bias,\nbut rather as a biological reality – relations between two people of the\nopposite sex are natural, and between two people of the same sex\nunnatural.

The theological meaning of\n‘natural’ is ‘in accordance with the intentions of the God who created\nnature’. Christian theologians argued that God created the human body,\nintending each limb and organ to serve a particular purpose. If we use\nour limbs and organs for the purpose envisioned by God, then it is a\nnatural activity. To use them differently than God intends is unnatural.\nBut evolution has no purpose. Organs have not evolved with a purpose,\nand the way they are used is in constant flux. There is not a single organ\nin the human body that only does the job its prototype did when it first\nappeared hundreds of millions of years ago. Organs evolve to perform a\nparticular function, but once they exist, they can be adapted for other\nusages as well. Mouths, for example, appeared because the earliest\nmulticellular organisms needed a way to take nutrients into their bodies.\nWe still use our mouths for that purpose, but we also use them to kiss,\nspeak and, if we are Rambo, to pull the pins out of hand grenades. Are\nany of these uses unnatural simply because our worm-like ancestors 600\nmillion years ago didn’t do those things with their mouths?\nSimilarly, wings didn’t suddenly appear in all their aerodynamic glory.\nThey developed from organs that served another purpose. According to\none theory, insect wings evolved millions of years ago from body\nprotrusions on flightless bugs. Bugs with bumps had a larger surface area\nthan those without bumps, and this enabled them to absorb more\nsunlight and thus stay warmer. In a slow evolutionary process, these\nsolar heaters grew larger. The same structure that was good for\nmaximum sunlight absorption – lots of surface area, little weight – also,\nby coincidence, gave the insects a bit of a lift when they skipped and\njumped. Those with bigger protrusions could skip and jump farther.\nSome insects started using the things to glide, and from there it was a\nsmall step to wings that could actually propel the bug through the air.\nNext time a mosquito buzzes in your ear, accuse her of unnatural\nbehaviour.

A man is not a Sapiens with particular biological\nqualities such as XY chromosomes, testicles and lots of testosterone.\nRather, he fits into a particular slot in his society’s imagined human\norder. His culture’s myths assign him particular masculine roles (like\nengaging in politics), rights (like voting) and duties (like military\nservice). Likewise, a woman is not a Sapiens with two X chromosomes, a\nwomb and plenty of oestrogen. Rather, she is a female member of an\nimagined human order. The myths of her society assign her unique\nfeminine roles (raising children), rights (protection against violence) and\nduties (obedience to her husband). Since myths, rather than biology,\ndefine the roles, rights and duties of men and women, the meaning of\n‘manhood’ and ‘womanhood’ have varied immensely from one society to\nanother."

A more subtle version of this claim argues that\ntheir strength allows men to monopolise tasks that demand hard manual\nlabour, such as ploughing and harvesting. This gives them control of\nfood production, which in turn translates into political clout.\nThere are two problems with this emphasis on muscle power. First, the\nstatement that men are stronger than women’ is true only on average,\nand only with regard to certain types of strength. Women are generally\nmore resistant to hunger, disease and fatigue than men. There are also\nmany women who can run faster and lift heavier weights than many\nmen. Furthermore, and most problematically for this theory, women\nhave, throughout history, been excluded mainly from jobs that require\nlittle physical effort (such as the priesthood, law and politics), while\nengaging in hard manual labour in the fields, in crafts and in the\nhousehold. If social power were divided in direct relation to physical\nstrength or stamina, women should have got far more of it.\nEven more importantly, there simply is no direct relation between\nphysical strength and social power among humans. People in their\nsixties usually exercise power over people in their twenties, even though\ntwentysomethings are much stronger than their elders. The typical\nplantation owner in Alabama in the mid-nineteenth century could have\nbeen wrestled to the ground in seconds by any of the slaves cultivating\nhis cotton fields. Boxing matches were not used to select Egyptian\npharaohs or Catholic popes. In forager societies, political dominance\ngenerally resides with the person possessing the best social skills rather\nthan the most developed musculature. In organised crime, the big boss is\nnot necessarily the strongest man. He is often an older man who very\nrarely uses his own fists; he gets younger and fitter men to do the dirty\njobs for him. A guy who thinks that the way to take over the syndicate is\nto beat up the don is unlikely to live long enough to learn from his\nmistake.

Since females need\nexternal help, they are obliged to develop their social skills and learn\nhow to cooperate and appease. They construct all-female social networks\nthat help each member raise her children. Males, meanwhile, spend their\ntime fighting and competing. Their social skills and social bonds remain\nunderdeveloped. Bonobo and elephant societies are controlled by strong\nnetworks of cooperative females, while the self-centred and\nuncooperative males are pushed to the sidelines. Though bonobo females\nare weaker on average than the males, the females often gang up to beat\nmales who overstep their limits.\nIf this is possible among bonobos and elephants, why not among Homo\nsapiens? Sapiens are relatively weak animals, whose advantage rests in\ntheir ability to cooperate in large numbers. If so, we should expect that\ndependent women, even if they are dependent on men, would use their\nsuperior social skills to cooperate to outmanoeuvre and manipulate\naggressive, autonomous and self-centred men.\nHow did it happen that in the one species whose success depends\nabove all on cooperation, individuals who are supposedly less\ncooperative (men) control individuals who are supposedly more\ncooperative (women)? At present, we have no good answer. Maybe the\ncommon assumptions are just wrong. Maybe males of the species Homo\nsapiens are characterised not by physical strength, aggressiveness and\ncompetitiveness, but rather by superior social skills and a greater\ntendency to cooperate.

They thereby created artificial instincts that\nenabled millions of strangers to cooperate effectively. This network of\nartificial instincts is called culture’.\nDuring the first half of the twentieth century, scholars taught that\nevery culture was complete and harmonious, possessing an unchanging\nessence that defined it for all time. Each human group had its own world\nview and system of social, legal and political arrangements that ran as\nsmoothly as the planets going around the sun. In this view, cultures left\nto their own devices did not change. They just kept going at the same\npace and in the same direction. Only a force applied from outside could\nchange them. Anthropologists, historians and politicians thus referred to\n‘Samoan Culture’ or ‘Tasmanian Culture’ as if the same beliefs, norms\nand values had characterised Samoans and Tasmanians from time\nimmemorial.\nToday, most scholars of culture have concluded that the opposite is\ntrue. Every culture has its typical beliefs, norms and values, but these are\nin constant flux. The culture may transform itself in response to changes\nin its environment or through interaction with neighbouring cultures.\nBut cultures also undergo transitions due to their own internal dynamics.\nEven a completely isolated culture existing in an ecologically stable"

Cultures are constantly trying to reconcile these\ncontradictions, and this process fuels change.\nFor instance, in medieval Europe the nobility believed in both\nChristianity and chivalry. A typical nobleman went to church in the\nmorning, and listened as the priest held forth on the lives of the saints.\n‘Vanity of vanities,’ said the priest, ‘all is vanity. Riches, lust and honour\nare dangerous temptations. You must rise above them, and follow in\nChrist’s footsteps. Be meek like Him, avoid violence and extravagance,\nand if attacked – just turn the other cheek.’ Returning home in a meek\nand pensive mood, the nobleman would change into his best silks and go\nto a banquet in his lord’s castle. There the wine flowed like water, the\nminstrel sang of Lancelot and Guinevere, and the guests exchanged dirty\njokes and bloody war tales. ‘It is better to die,’ declared the barons, ‘than\nto live with shame. If someone questions your honour, only blood can\nwipe out the insult. And what is better in life than to see your enemies\nflee before you, and their pretty daughters tremble at your feet?’\nThe contradiction was never fully resolved. But as the European\nnobility, clergy and commoners grappled with it, their culture changed.\nOne attempt to figure it out produced the Crusades. On crusade, knights\ncould demonstrate their military prowess and their religious devotion at\none stroke. The same contradiction produced military orders such as the\nTemplars and Hospitallers, who tried to mesh Christian and chivalric\nideals even more tightly. It was also responsible for a large part of\nmedieval art and literature, such as the tales of King Arthur and the Holy\nGrail. What was Camelot but an attempt to prove that a good knight can\nand should be a good Christian, and that good Christians make the best\nknights?\nAnother example is the modern political order. Ever since the French\nRevolution, people throughout the world have gradually come to see\nboth equality and individual freedom as fundamental values. Yet the two\nvalues contradict each other. Equality can be ensured only by curtailing\nthe freedoms of those who are better off. Guaranteeing that every\nindividual will be free to do as he wishes inevitably short-changes\nequality. The entire political history of the world since 1789 can be seen\nas a series of attempts to reconcile this contradiction."

Anyone\nwho has read a novel by Alexander Solzhenitsyn knows how\nCommunisms egalitarian ideal produced brutal tyrannies that tried to\ncontrol every aspect of daily life.\nContemporary American politics also revolve around this\ncontradiction. Democrats want a more equitable society, even if it means\nraising taxes to fund programmes to help the poor, elderly and infirm.\nBut that infringes on the freedom of individuals to spend their money as\nthey wish. Why should the government force me to buy health insurance\nif I prefer using the money to put my kids through college? Republicans,\non the other hand, want to maximise individual freedom, even if it\nmeans that the income gap between rich and poor will grow wider and\nthat many Americans will not be able to afford health care.\nJust as medieval culture did not manage to square chivalry with\nChristianity, so the modern world fails to square liberty with equality.\nBut this is no defect. Such contradictions are an inseparable part of every\nhuman culture. In fact, they are culture’s engines, responsible for the\ncreativity and dynamism of our species. Just as when two clashing\nmusical notes played together force a piece of music forward, so discord\nin our thoughts, ideas and values compel us to think, reevaluate and\ncriticise. Consistency is the playground of dull minds.\nIf tensions, conflicts and irresolvable dilemmas are the spice of every\nculture, a human being who belongs to any particular culture must hold\ncontradictory beliefs and be riven by incompatible values. It’s such an\nessential feature of any culture that it even has a name: cognitive\ndissonance. Cognitive dissonance is often considered a failure of the\nhuman psyche. In fact, it is a vital asset. Had people been unable to hold\ncontradictory beliefs and values, it would probably have been impossible\nto establish and maintain any human culture.\nIf, say, a Christian really wants to understand the Muslims who attend\nthat mosque down the street, he shouldn’t look for a pristine set of\nvalues that every Muslim holds dear. Rather, he should enquire into the\ncatch-22s of Muslim culture, those places where rules are at war and\nstandards scuffle. It’s at the very spot where the Muslims teeter between"

Only a criminal\nbuys a house, for example, by handing over a suitcase full of banknotes.\nAs long as people are willing to trade goods and services in exchange for\nelectronic data, it’s even better than shiny coins and crisp banknotes –\nlighter, less bulky, and easier to keep track of.\nFor complex commercial systems to function, some kind of money is\nindispensable. A shoemaker in a money economy needs to know only the\nprices charged for various kinds of shoes – there is no need to memorise\nthe exchange rates between shoes and apples or goats. Money also frees\napple experts from the need to search out apple-craving shoemakers,\nbecause everyone always wants money. This is perhaps its most basic\nquality. Everyone always wants money because everyone else also\nalways wants money, which means you can exchange money for\nwhatever you want or need. The shoemaker will always be happy to take\nyour money, because no matter what he really wants – apples, goats or a\ndivorce – he can get it in exchange for money.\nMoney is thus a universal medium of exchange that enables people to\nconvert almost everything into almost anything else. Brawn gets\nconverted to brain when a discharged soldier finances his college tuition\nwith his military benefits. Land gets converted into loyalty when a baron\nsells property to support his retainers. Health is converted to justice\nwhen a physician uses her fees to hire a lawyer – or bribe a judge.

And we\nall believe in them because our king believes in them and demands them\nin taxes, and because our priest believes in them and demands them in\ntithes.

The crucial role of trust explains why our\nfinancial systems are so tightly bound up with our political, social and\nideological systems, why financial crises are often triggered by political\ndevelopments, and why the stock market can rise or fall depending on\nthe way traders feel on a particular morning.\nInitially, when the first versions of money were created, people didn’t\nhave this sort of trust, so it was necessary to define as ‘money’ things\nthat had real intrinsic value.

It appeared in Sumer around 3000 ,\nBC\nat the same time and place, and under the same circumstances, in which\nwriting appeared. Just as writing developed to answer the needs of\nintensifying administrative activities, so barley money developed to\nanswer the needs of intensifying economic activities.\nBarley money was simply barley – fixed amounts of barley grains used\nas a universal measure for evaluating and exchanging all other goods\nand services. The most common measurement was the sila, equivalent to\nroughly one litre. Standardised bowls, each capable of containing one\nsila, were mass-produced so that whenever people needed to buy or sell\nanything, it was easy to measure the necessary amounts of barley.\nSalaries, too, were set and paid in silas of barley. A male labourer earned\nsixty silas a month, a female labourer thirty silas. A foreman could earn\nbetween 1,200 and 5,000 silas.

In\norder to understand why, just think what would happen if you took a\nsack full of barley to your local shopping centre, and tried to buy a shirt\nor a pizza. The vendors would probably call security. Still, it was\nsomewhat easier to build trust in barley as the first type of money,\nbecause barley has an inherent biological value. Humans can eat it. On\nthe other hand, it was difficult to store and transport barley. The real\nbreakthrough in monetary history occurred when people gained trust in\nmoney that lacked inherent value, but was easier to store and transport.\nSuch money appeared in ancient Mesopotamia in the middle of the third\nmillennium . This was the silver shekel.\nBC\nThe silver shekel was not a coin, but rather 8.33 grams of silver. When\nHammurabi’s Code declared that a superior man who killed a slave\nwoman must pay her owner twenty silver shekels, it meant that he had\nto pay 166 grams of silver, not twenty coins. Most monetary terms in the\nOld Testament are given in terms of silver rather than coins. Josephs\nbrothers sold him to the Ishmaelites for twenty silver shekels, or rather\n166 grams of silver (the same price as a slave woman – he was a youth,\nafter all).\nUnlike the barley sila, the silver shekel had no inherent value. You\ncannot eat, drink or clothe yourself in silver, and it’s too soft for making\nuseful tools – ploughshares or swords of silver would crumple almost as\nfast as ones made out of aluminium foil. When they are used for\nanything, silver and gold are made into jewellery, crowns and other\nstatus symbols – luxury goods that members of a particular culture\nidentify with high social status. Their value is purely cultural.\nSet weights of precious metals eventually gave birth to coins. The first\ncoins in history were struck around 640 by King Alyattes of Lydia, in\nBC\nwestern Anatolia. These coins had a standardised weight of gold or\nsilver, and were imprinted with an identification mark. The mark\ntestified to two things. First, it indicated how much precious metal the\ncoin contained. Second, it identified the authority that issued the coin"

Almost all coins in use today are\ndescendants of the Lydian coins.\nCoins had two important advantages over unmarked metal ingots.\nFirst, the latter had to be weighed for every transaction. Second,\nweighing the ingot is not enough. How does the shoemaker know that\nthe silver ingot I put down for my boots is really made of pure silver,\nand not of lead covered on the outside by a thin silver coating? Coins\nhelp solve these problems. The mark imprinted on them testifies to their\nexact value, so the shoemaker doesn’t have to keep a scale on his cash\nregister. More importantly, the mark on the coin is the signature of some\npolitical authority that guarantees the coin’s value.\nThe shape and size of the mark varied tremendously throughout\nhistory, but the message was always the same: ‘I, the Great King So-And-\nSo, give you my personal word that this metal disc contains exactly five\ngrams of gold. If anyone dares counterfeit this coin, it means he is\nfabricating my own signature, which would be a blot on my reputation. I\nwill punish such a crime with the utmost severity.’ That’s why\ncounterfeiting money has always been considered a much more serious\ncrime than other acts of deception. Counterfeiting is not just cheating –\nit’s a breach of sovereignty, an act of subversion against the power,\nprivileges and person of the king. The legal term is lese-majesty\n(violating majesty), and was typically punished by torture and death. As\nlong as people trusted the power and integrity of the king, they trusted\nhis coins.

In the first\ncentury , Roman coins were an accepted medium of exchange in the\nAD\nmarkets of India, even though the closest Roman legion was thousands\nof kilometres away. The Indians had such a strong confidence in the\ndenarius and the image of the emperor that when local rulers struck\ncoins of their own they closely imitated the denarius, down to the\nportrait of the Roman emperor! The name ‘denarius’ became a generic\nname for coins. Muslim caliphs Arabicised this name and issued ‘dinars’.\nThe dinar is still the official name of the currency in Jordan, Iraq, Serbia,\nMacedonia, Tunisia and several other countries.\nAs Lydian-style coinage was spreading from the Mediterranean to the\nIndian Ocean, China developed a slightly different monetary system,\nbased on bronze coins and unmarked silver and gold ingots. Yet the two\nmonetary systems had enough in common (especially the reliance on\ngold and silver) that close monetary and commercial relations were\nestablished between the Chinese zone and the Lydian zone. Muslim and\nEuropean merchants and conquerors gradually spread the Lydian system\nand the gospel of gold to the far corners of the earth. By the late modern\nera the entire world was a single monetary zone, relying first on gold\nand silver, and later on a few trusted currencies such as the British\npound and the American dollar."

How many peoples exactly? Two or three is not\nsufficient. Twenty or thirty is plenty. The imperial threshold passes\nsomewhere in between.\nSecond, empires are characterised by flexible borders and a potentially\nunlimited appetite.

Every people has a right to\nself-determination, and should never be subject to the rule of another.\nFrom a historical perspective, the first statement is plain nonsense,\nand the second is deeply problematic.\nThe truth is that empire has been the world’s most common form of\npolitical organisation for the last 2,500 years. Most humans during these\ntwo and a half millennia have lived in empires. Empire is also a very\nstable form of government. Most empires have found it alarmingly easy\nto put down rebellions.

There were neither synagogues, volumes of Talmud, nor even\nTorah scrolls in ancient Judaea.\nBuilding and maintaining an empire usually required the vicious\nslaughter of large populations and the brutal oppression of everyone\nwho was left. The standard imperial toolkit included wars, enslavement,\ndeportation and genocide. When the Romans invaded Scotland in 83,\nAD\nthey were met by fierce resistance from local Caledonian tribes, and\nreacted by laying waste to the country. In reply to Roman peace offers,\nthe chieftain Calgacus called the Romans ‘the ruffians of the world’, and\nsaid that ‘to plunder, slaughter and robbery they give the lying name of\nempire; they make a desert and call it peace’.2\nThis does not mean, however, that empires leave nothing of value in\ntheir wake. To colour all empires black and to disavow all imperial\nlegacies is to reject most of human culture. Imperial elites used the\nprofits of conquest to finance not only armies and forts but also\nphilosophy, art, justice and charity. A significant proportion of\nhumanity’s cultural achievements owe their existence to the exploitation\nof conquered populations. The profits and prosperity brought by Roman\nimperialism provided Cicero, Seneca and St Augustine with the leisure\nand wherewithal to think and write; the Taj Mahal could not have been\nbuilt without the wealth accumulated by Mughal exploitation of their\nIndian subjects; and the Habsburg Empire’s profits from its rule over its\nSlavic, Hungarian and Romanian-speaking provinces paid Haydn’s\nsalaries and Mozart’s commissions. No Caledonian writer preserved\nCalgacus’ speech for posterity. We know of it thanks to the Roman\nhistorian Tacitus. In fact, Tacitus probably made it up. Most scholars\ntoday agree that Tacitus not only fabricated the speech but invented the\ncharacter of Calgacus, the Caledonian chieftain, to serve as a mouthpiece\nfor what he and other upper-class Romans thought about their own\ncountry."

The Mandate of Heaven was\nbestowed upon the emperor not in order to exploit the world, but in\norder to educate humanity. The Romans, too, justified their dominion by\narguing that they were endowing the barbarians with peace, justice and\nrefinement. The wild Germans and painted Gauls had lived in squalor\nand ignorance until the Romans tamed them with law, cleaned them up\nin public bathhouses, and improved them with philosophy.

Yet, in fact, religion has been the third great\nunifier of humankind, alongside money and empires. Since all social\norders and hierarchies are imagined, they are all fragile, and the larger\nthe society, the more fragile it is. The crucial historical role of religion\nhas been to give superhuman legitimacy to these fragile structures.\nReligions assert that our laws are not the result of human caprice, but\nare ordained by an absolute and supreme authority. This helps place at\nleast some fundamental laws beyond challenge, thereby ensuring social\nstability.\nReligion can thus be defined as a system of human norms and values that\nis founded on a belief in a superhuman order. This involves two distinct\ncriteria:\n1. Religions hold that there is a superhuman order, which is not the\nproduct of human whims or agreements. Professional football is not a\nreligion, because despite its many laws, rites and often bizarre rituals,\neveryone knows that human beings invented football themselves, and\nFIFA may at any moment enlarge the size of the goal or cancel the\noffside rule.\n2. Based on this superhuman order, religion establishes norms and\nvalues that it considers binding. Many Westerners today believe in\nghosts, fairies and reincarnation, but these beliefs are not a source of\nmoral and behavioural standards. As such, they do not constitute a\nreligion.\nDespite their ability to legitimise widespread social and political\norders, not all religions have actuated this potential. In order to unite\nunder its aegis a large expanse of territory inhabited by disparate groups\nof human beings, a religion must possess two further qualities. First, it\nmust espouse a universal superhuman order that is true always and\neverywhere. Second, it must insist on spreading this belief to everyone.\nIn other words, it must be universal and missionary.\nThe best-known religions of history, such as Islam and Buddhism, are\nuniversal and missionary. Consequently people tend to believe that all\nreligions are like them. In fact, the majority of ancient religions were\nlocal and exclusive. Their followers believed in local deities and spirits,"

Their emergence was one of the most important\nBC\nrevolutions in history, and made a vital contribution to the unification of\nhumankind, much like the emergence of universal empires and universal\nmoney.\nSilencing the Lambs\nWhen animism was the dominant belief system, human norms and\nvalues had to take into consideration the outlook and interests of a\nmultitude of other beings, such as animals, plants, fairies and ghosts. For\nexample, a forager band in the Ganges Valley may have established a\nrule forbidding people to cut down a particularly large fig tree, lest the\nfig-tree spirit become angry and take revenge. Another forager band\nliving in the Indus Valley may have forbidden people from hunting\nwhite-tailed foxes, because a white-tailed fox once revealed to a wise old\nwoman where the band might find precious obsidian.\nSuch religions tended to be very local in outlook, and to emphasise the\nunique features of specific locations, climates and phenomena. Most\nforagers spent their entire lives within an area of no more than a\nthousand square kilometres. In order to survive, the inhabitants of a\nparticular valley needed to understand the superhuman order that\nregulated their valley, and to adjust their behaviour accordingly.

Hence the first religious effect of\nthe Agricultural Revolution was to turn plants and animals from equal\nmembers of a spiritual round table into property.\nThis, however, created a big problem. Farmers may have desired\nabsolute control of their sheep, but they knew perfectly well that their\ncontrol was limited. They could lock the sheep in pens, castrate rams\nand selectively breed ewes, yet they could not ensure that the ewes\nconceived and gave birth to healthy lambs, nor could they prevent the\neruption of deadly epidemics. How then to safeguard the fecundity of\nthe flocks?\nA leading theory about the origin of the gods argues that gods gained\nimportance because they offered a solution to this problem. Gods such as\nthe fertility goddess, the sky god and the god of medicine took centre\nstage when plants and animals lost their ability to speak, and the gods’\nmain role was to mediate between humans and the mute plants and\nanimals. Much of ancient mythology is in fact a legal contract in which\nhumans promise everlasting devotion to the gods in exchange for\nmastery over plants and animals – the first chapters of the book of\nGenesis are a prime example. For thousands of years after the\nAgricultural Revolution, religious liturgy consisted mainly of humans\nsacrificing lambs, wine and cakes to divine powers, who in exchange\npromised abundant harvests and fecund flocks.\nThe Agricultural Revolution initially had a far smaller impact on the\nstatus of other members of the animist system, such as rocks, springs,\nghosts and demons. However, these too gradually lost status in favour of\nthe new gods. As long as people lived their entire lives within limited\nterritories of a few hundred square kilometres, most of their needs could\nbe met by local spirits. But once kingdoms and trade networks expanded,\npeople needed to contact entities whose power and authority\nencompassed a whole kingdom or an entire trade basin.\nThe attempt to answer these needs led to the appearance of\npolytheistic religions (from the Greek: poly = many, theos = god). These\nreligions understood the world to be controlled by a group of powerful\ngods, such as the fertility goddess, the rain god and the war god.\nHumans could appeal to these gods and the gods might, if they received\ndevotions and sacrifices, deign to bring rain, victory and health."

These spirits were far\nless important than the great gods, but for the mundane needs of many\nordinary people, they were good enough. While the king in his capital\ncity sacrificed dozens of fat rams to the great war god, praying for\nvictory over the barbarians, the peasant in his hut lit a candle to the fig-\ntree fairy, praying that she help cure his sick son.\nYet the greatest impact of the rise of great gods was not on sheep or\ndemons, but upon the status of Homo sapiens. Animists thought that\nhumans were just one of many creatures inhabiting the world.\nPolytheists, on the other hand, increasingly saw the world as a reflection\nof the relationship between gods and humans. Our prayers, our\nsacrifices, our sins and our good deeds determined the fate of the entire\necosystem. A terrible flood might wipe out billions of ants, grasshoppers,\nturtles, antelopes, giraffes and elephants, just because a few stupid\nSapiens made the gods angry.

In fact, most polytheist and\neven animist religions recognised such a supreme power that stands\nbehind all the different gods, demons and holy rocks. In classical Greek\npolytheism, Zeus, Hera, Apollo and their colleagues were subject to an\nomnipotent and all-encompassing power – Fate (Moira, Ananke).

In Hindu polytheism, a\nsingle principle, Atman, controls the myriad gods and spirits,\nhumankind, and the biological and physical world. Atman is the eternal\nessence or soul of the entire universe, as well as of every individual and\nevery phenomenon.\nThe fundamental insight of polytheism, which distinguishes it from\nmonotheism, is that the supreme power governing the world is devoid of\ninterests and biases, and therefore it is unconcerned with the mundane\ndesires, cares and worries of humans. It’s pointless to ask this power for\nvictory in war, for health or for rain, because from its all-encompassing\nvantage point, it makes no difference whether a particular kingdom wins\nor loses, whether a particular city prospers or withers, whether a\nparticular person recuperates or dies. The Greeks did not waste any\nsacrifices on Fate, and Hindus built no temples to Atman.\nThe only reason to approach the supreme power of the universe would\nbe to renounce all desires and embrace the bad along with the good – to\nembrace even defeat, poverty, sickness and death. Thus some Hindus,\nknown as Sadhus or Sannyasis, devote their lives to uniting with Atman,\nthereby achieving enlightenment. They strive to see the world from the\nviewpoint of this fundamental principle, to realise that from its eternal\nperspective all mundane desires and fears are meaningless and\nephemeral phenomena.\nMost Hindus, however, are not Sadhus. They are sunk deep in the\nmorass of mundane concerns, where Atman is not much help. For\nassistance in such matters, Hindus approach the gods with their partial\npowers. Precisely because their powers are partial rather than all-\nencompassing, gods such as Ganesha, Lakshmi and Saraswati have\ninterests and biases. Humans can therefore make deals with these partial\npowers and rely on their help in order to win wars and recuperate from\nillness. There are necessarily many of these smaller powers, since once\nyou start dividing up the all-encompassing power of a supreme principle,\nyou’ll inevitably end up with more than one deity.

Why is\nthere suffering? Why do bad things happen to good people?’ Monotheists\nhave to practise intellectual gymnastics to explain how an all-knowing,\nall-powerful and perfectly good God allows so much suffering in the\nworld. One well-known explanation is that this is God’s way of allowing\nfor human free will. Were there no evil, humans could not choose\nbetween good and evil, and hence there would be no free will. This,\nhowever, is a non-intuitive answer that immediately raises a host of new\nquestions. Freedom of will allows humans to choose evil. Many indeed\nchoose evil and, according to the standard monotheist account, this\nchoice must bring divine punishment in its wake. If God knew in\nadvance that a particular person would use her free will to choose evil,\nand that as a result she would be punished for this by eternal tortures in\nhell, why did God create her?

If the world was created by a\nsingle God, it’s clear why it is such an orderly place, where everything\nobeys the same laws. But if Good and Evil battle for control of the world,\nwho enforces the laws governing this cosmic war? Two rival states can\nfight one another because both obey the same laws of physics. A missile\nlaunched from Pakistan can hit targets in India because gravity works\nthe same way in both countries.

Jewish, Christian and Muslim monotheism absorbed numerous\ndualist beliefs and practices, and some of the most basic ideas of what\nwe call ‘monotheism’ are, in fact, dualist in origin and spirit. Countless\nChristians, Muslims and Jews believe in a powerful evil force – like the\none Christians call the Devil or Satan – who can act independently, fight\nagainst the good God, and wreak havoc without God’s permission.\nHow can a monotheist adhere to such a dualistic belief (which, by the\nway, is nowhere to be found in the Old Testament)? Logically, it is\nimpossible. Either you believe in a single omnipotent God or you believe\nin two opposing powers, neither of which is omnipotent.

Countless Christians, Muslims and Jews have gone\nso far as to imagine that the good God even needs our help in its struggle\nagainst the Devil, which inspired among other things the call for jihads\nand crusades.\nAnother key dualistic concept, particularly in Gnosticism and\nManichaeanism, was the sharp distinction between body and soul,\nbetween matter and spirit. Gnostics and Manichaeans argued that the\ngood god created the spirit and the soul, whereas matter and bodies are\nthe creation of the evil god. Man, according to this view, serves as a\nbattleground between the good soul and the evil body. From a\nmonotheistic perspective, this is nonsense – why distinguish so sharply\nbetween body and soul, or matter and spirit? And why argue that body\nand matter are evil? After all, everything was created by the same good\nGod. But monotheists could not help but be captivated by dualist\ndichotomies, precisely because they helped them address the problem of\nevil. So such oppositions eventually became cornerstones of Christian\nand Muslim thought. Belief in heaven (the realm of the good god) and\nhell (the realm of the evil god) was also dualist in origin.

The newcomers, such as Jainism and\nBuddhism in India, Daoism and Confucianism in China, and Stoicism,\nCynicism and Epicureanism in the Mediterranean basin, were\ncharacterised by their disregard of gods.\nThese creeds maintained that the superhuman order governing the\nworld is the product of natural laws rather than of divine wills and\nwhims. Some of these natural-law religions continued to espouse the\nexistence of gods, but their gods were subject to the laws of nature no\nless than humans, animals and plants were. Gods had their niche in the\necosystem, just as elephants and porcupines had theirs, but could no\nmore change the laws of nature than elephants can. A prime example is\nBuddhism, the most important of the ancient natural law religions,\nwhich remains one of the major faiths.\nThe central figure of Buddhism is not a god but a human being,\nSiddhartha Gautama. According to Buddhist tradition, Gautama was heir\nto a small Himalayan kingdom, sometime around 500 . The young\nBC\nprince was deeply affected by the suffering evident all around him. He"

People pursue wealth and\npower, acquire knowledge and possessions, beget sons and daughters,\nand build houses and palaces. Yet no matter what they achieve, they are\nnever content. Those who live in poverty dream of riches. Those who\nhave a million want two million. Those who have two million want 10\nmillion. Even the rich and famous are rarely satisfied. They too are\nhaunted by ceaseless cares and worries, until sickness, old age and death\nput a bitter end to them. Everything that one has accumulated vanishes\nlike smoke. Life is a pointless rat race. But how to escape it?\nAt the age of twenty-nine Gautama slipped away from his palace in\nthe middle of the night, leaving behind his family and possessions. He\ntravelled as a homeless vagabond throughout northern India, searching\nfor a way out of suffering. He visited ashrams and sat at the feet of gurus\nbut nothing liberated him entirely – some dissatisfaction always\nremained. He did not despair. He resolved to investigate suffering on his\nown until he found a method for complete liberation. He spent six years\nmeditating on the essence, causes and cures for human anguish. In the\nend he came to the realisation that suffering is not caused by ill fortune,\nby social injustice, or by divine whims. Rather, suffering is caused by the\nbehaviour patterns of one’s own mind.\nGautama’s insight was that no matter what the mind experiences, it\nusually reacts with craving, and craving always involves dissatisfaction.\nWhen the mind experiences something distasteful it craves to be rid of\nthe irritation. When the mind experiences something pleasant, it craves\nthat the pleasure will remain and will intensify. Therefore, the mind is\nalways dissatisfied and restless. This is very clear when we experience\nunpleasant things, such as pain. As long as the pain continues, we are\ndissatisfied and do all we can to avoid it. Yet even when we experience\npleasant things we are never content. We either fear that the pleasure\nmight disappear, or we hope that it will intensify. People dream for\nyears about finding love but are rarely satisfied when they find it. Some\nbecome anxious that their partner will leave; others feel that they have\nsettled cheaply, and could have found someone better. And we all know\npeople who manage to do both."

These practices train the\nmind to focus all its attention on the question, ‘What am I experiencing\nnow?’ rather than on ‘What would I rather be experiencing?’ It is\ndifficult to achieve this state of mind, but not impossible.\nGautama grounded these meditation techniques in a set of ethical\nrules meant to make it easier for people to focus on actual experience\nand to avoid falling into cravings and fantasies. He instructed his\nfollowers to avoid killing, promiscuous sex and theft, since such acts\nnecessarily stoke the fire of craving (for power, for sensual pleasure, or\nfor wealth). When the flames are completely extinguished, craving is\nreplaced by a state of perfect contentment and serenity, known as\nnirvana (the literal meaning of which is ‘extinguishing the fire’). Those\nwho have attained nirvana are fully liberated from all suffering. They\nexperience reality with the utmost clarity, free of fantasies and\ndelusions. While they will most likely still encounter unpleasantness and\npain, such experiences cause them no misery. A person who does not\ncrave cannot suffer.\nAccording to Buddhist tradition, Gautama himself attained nirvana\nand was fully liberated from suffering. Henceforth he was known as\n‘Buddha’, which means ‘The Enlightened One’. Buddha spent the rest of\nhis life explaining his discoveries to others so that everyone could be\nfreed from suffering. He encapsulated his teachings in a single law:\nsuffering arises from craving; the only way to be fully liberated from\nsuffering is to be fully liberated from craving; and the only way to be\nliberated from craving is to train the mind to experience reality as it is.\nThis law, known as dharma or dhamma, is seen by Buddhists as a\nuniversal law of nature. That ‘suffering arises from craving’ is always\nand everywhere true, just as in modern physics E always equals mc2.\nBuddhists are people who believe in this law and make it the fulcrum of\nall their activities. Belief in gods, on the other hand, is of minor\nimportance to them. The first principle of monotheist religions is ‘God\nexists. What does He want from me?’ The first principle of Buddhism is\n‘Suffering exists. How do I escape it?’\nBuddhism does not deny the existence of gods – they are described as\npowerful beings who can bring rains and victories – but they have no\ninfluence on the law that suffering arises from craving.

However, 99 per cent\nof Buddhists did not attain nirvana, and even if they hoped to do so in\nsome future lifetime, they devoted most of their present lives to the\npursuit of mundane achievements.

Humanism is a\nbelief that Homo sapiens has a unique and sacred nature, which is\nfundamentally different from the nature of all other animals and of all\nother phenomena.

Today, the most important humanist sect is\nliberal humanism, which believes that ‘humanity’ is a quality of\nindividual humans, and that the liberty of individuals is therefore\nsacrosanct. According to liberals, the sacred nature of humanity resides\nwithin each and every individual Homo sapiens. The inner core of\nindividual humans gives meaning to the world, and is the source for all\nethical and political authority. If we encounter an ethical or political\ndilemma, we should look inside and listen to our inner voice – the voice\nof humanity.

In today’s Europe, murder is seen as a violation of the\nsacred nature of humanity. In order to restore order, present-day\nEuropeans do not torture and execute criminals. Instead, they punish a\nmurderer in what they see as the most ‘humane’ way possible, thus\nsafeguarding and even rebuilding his human sanctity. By honouring the\nhuman nature of the murderer, everyone is reminded of the sanctity of\nhumanity, and order is restored. By defending the murderer, we right\nwhat the murderer has wronged.\nEven though liberal humanism sanctifies humans, it does not deny the\nexistence of God, and is, in fact, founded on monotheist beliefs. The\nliberal belief in the free and sacred nature of each individual is a direct\nlegacy of the traditional Christian belief in free and eternal individual\nsouls. Without recourse to eternal souls and a Creator God, it becomes\nembarrassingly difficult for liberals to explain what is so special about\nindividual Sapiens.\nAnother important sect is socialist humanism. Socialists believe that\n‘humanity’ is collective rather than individualistic. They hold as sacred\nnot the inner voice of each individual, but the species Homo sapiens as a\nwhole. Whereas liberal humanism seeks as much freedom as possible for\nindividual humans, socialist humanism seeks equality between all\nhumans. According to socialists, inequality is the worst blasphemy\nagainst the sanctity of humanity, because it privileges peripheral\nqualities of humans over their universal essence. For example, when the\nrich are privileged over the poor, it means that we value money more\nthan the universal essence of all humans, which is the same for rich and\npoor alike.\nLike liberal humanism, socialist humanism is built on monotheist\nfoundations.

In contrast to other humanists, the\nNazis believed that humankind is not something universal and eternal,\nbut rather a mutable species that can evolve or degenerate. Man can\nevolve into superman, or degenerate into a subhuman.\nThe main ambition of the Nazis was to protect humankind from\ndegeneration and encourage its progressive evolution. This is why the\nNazis said that the Aryan race, the most advanced form of humanity,\nhad to be protected and fostered, while degenerate kinds of Homo sapiens\nlike Jews, Roma, homosexuals and the mentally ill had to be\nquarantined and even exterminated. The Nazis explained that Homo\nsapiens itself appeared when one ‘superior’ population of ancient humans\nevolved, whereas ‘inferior’ populations such as the Neanderthals became\nextinct. These different populations were at first no more than different\nraces, but developed independently along their own evolutionary paths.\nThis might well happen again. According to the Nazis, Homo sapiens had\nalready divided into several distinct races, each with its own unique\nqualities. One of these races, the Aryan race, had the finest qualities –\nrationalism, beauty, integrity, diligence. The Aryan race therefore had\nthe potential to turn man into superman. Other races, such as Jews and\nblacks, were today’s Neanderthals, possessing inferior qualities.

It\nis natural and inevitable that we live in nation states, organise our\neconomy along capitalist principles, and fervently believe in human\nrights. To acknowledge that history is not deterministic is to\nacknowledge that it is just a coincidence that most people today believe\nin nationalism, capitalism and human rights.\nHistory cannot be explained deterministically and it cannot be\npredicted because it is chaotic. So many forces are at work and their\ninteractions are so complex that extremely small variations in the\nstrength of the forces and the way they interact produce huge differences\nin outcomes. Not only that, but history is what is called a ‘level two’\nchaotic system. Chaotic systems come in two shapes. Level one chaos is\nchaos that does not react to predictions about it. The weather, for\nexample, is a level one chaotic system. Though it is influenced by myriad\nfactors, we can build computer models that take more and more of them\ninto consideration, and produce better and better weather forecasts.\nLevel two chaos is chaos that reacts to predictions about it, and\ntherefore can never be predicted accurately. Markets, for example, are a\nlevel two chaotic system. What will happen if we develop a computer\nprogram that forecasts with 100 per cent accuracy the price of oil\ntomorrow? The price of oil will immediately react to the forecast, which\nwould consequently fail to materialise. If the current price of oil is $90 a\nbarrel, and the infallible computer program predicts that tomorrow it\nwill be $100, traders will rush to buy oil so that they can profit from the\npredicted price rise. As a result, the price will shoot up to $100 a barrel\ntoday rather than tomorrow. Then what will happen tomorrow? Nobody\nknows.\nPolitics, too, is a second-order chaotic system. Many people criticise\nSovietologists for failing to predict the 1989 revolutions and castigate\nMiddle East experts for not anticipating the Arab Spring revolutions of\n2011. This is unfair. Revolutions are, by definition, unpredictable. A\npredictable revolution never erupts.\nWhy not?

There is no proof that\ncultures that are beneficial to humans must inexorably succeed and\nspread, while less beneficial cultures disappear. There is no proof that\nChristianity was a better choice than Manichaeism, or that the Arab\nEmpire was more beneficial than that of the Sassanid Persians.\nThere is no proof that history is working for the benefit of humans\nbecause we lack an objective scale on which to measure such benefit."

But these benefits are evident only if we\naccept the Muslim world view. It may well be that we’d all be better off\nif Christianity and Islam had been forgotten or defeated.\nEver more scholars see cultures as a kind of mental infection or\nparasite, with humans as its unwitting host. Organic parasites, such as\nviruses, live inside the body of their hosts. They multiply and spread\nfrom one host to the other, feeding off their hosts, weakening them, and\nsometimes even killing them. As long as the hosts live long enough to\npass along the parasite, it cares little about the condition of its host. In\njust this fashion, cultural ideas live inside the minds of humans. They\nmultiply and spread from one host to another, occasionally weakening\nthe hosts and sometimes even killing them. A cultural idea – such as\nbelief in Christian heaven above the clouds or Communist paradise here\non earth – can compel a human to dedicate his or her life to spreading\nthat idea, even at the price of death. The human dies, but the idea\nspreads. According to this approach, cultures are not conspiracies\nconcocted by some people in order to take advantage of others (as\nMarxists tend to think). Rather, cultures are mental parasites that\nemerge accidentally, and thereafter take advantage of all people infected\nby them.\nThis approach is sometimes called memetics. It assumes that, just as\norganic evolution is based on the replication of organic information units\ncalled ‘genes’, so cultural evolution is based on the replication of cultural\ninformation units called ‘memes’.1 Successful cultures are those that\nexcel in reproducing their memes, irrespective of the costs and benefits\nto their human hosts.\nMost scholars in the humanities disdain memetics, seeing it as an\namateurish attempt to explain cultural processes with crude biological\nanalogies.

The\nnationalist virus presented itself as being beneficial for humans, yet it\nhas been beneficial mainly to itself.\nSimilar arguments are common in the social sciences, under the aegis\nof game theory.

Many arms\nraces bankrupt all those who take part in them, without really changing\nthe military balance of power. When Pakistan buys advanced aeroplanes,\nIndia responds in kind. When India develops nuclear bombs, Pakistan\nfollows suit. When Pakistan enlarges its navy, India counters. At the end\nof the process, the balance of power may remain much as it was, but\nmeanwhile billions of dollars that could have been invested in education\nor health are spent on weapons.

In every age, even the\nmost pious and conservative, there were people who argued that there\nwere important things of which their entire tradition was ignorant. Yet\nsuch people were usually marginalised or persecuted – or else they\nfounded a new tradition and began arguing that they knew everything\nthere is to know.

That is, while Maclaurin could\nnot use maths to predict whether Webster and Wallace would die next\nyear, he could, given enough data, tell Webster and Wallace how many\nPresbyterian ministers in Scotland would almost certainly die next year.\nFortunately, they had ready-made data that they could use. Actuary\ntables published fifty years previously by Edmond Halley proved\nparticularly useful. Halley had analysed records of 1,238 births and\n1,174 deaths that he obtained from the city of Breslau, Germany.\nHalley’s tables made it possible to see that, for example, a twenty-year-\nold person has a 1:100 chance of dying in a given year, but a fifty-year-\nold person has a 1:39 chance.\nProcessing these numbers, Webster and Wallace concluded that, on\naverage, there would be 930 living Scottish Presbyterian ministers at any\ngiven moment, and an average of twenty-seven ministers would die each\nyear, eighteen of whom would be survived by widows. Five of those who\ndid not leave widows would leave orphaned children, and two of those\nsurvived by widows would also be outlived by children from previous\nmarriages who had not yet reached the age of sixteen. They further\ncomputed how much time was likely to go by before the widows’ death\nor remarriage (in both these eventualities, payment of the pension would\ncease). These figures enabled Webster and Wallace to determine how\nmuch money the ministers who joined their fund had to pay in order to\nprovide for their loved ones. By contributing £2 12s. 2d. a year, a\nminister could guarantee that his widowed wife would receive at least\n£10 a year – a hefty sum in those days. If he thought that was not\nenough he could choose to pay in more, up to a level of £6 11s. 3d. a\nyear – which would guarantee his widow the even more handsome sum\nof £25 a year.\nAccording to their calculations, by the year 1765 the Fund for a\nProvision for the Widows and Children of the Ministers of the Church of\nScotland would have capital totalling £58,348. Their calculations proved\namazingly accurate. When that year arrived, the fund’s capital stood at\n£58,347 – just £1 less than the prediction!

Demography in its turn was the cornerstone on which Charles\nDarwin (who almost became an Anglican pastor) built his theory of\nevolution.

In academic circles, many are naïve\nenough to believe in pure science.

But this hardly describes the realities of\nscience funding.\nMost scientific studies are funded because somebody believes they can\nhelp attain some political, economic or religious goal. For example, in\nthe sixteenth century, kings and bankers channelled enormous resources\nto finance geographical expeditions around the world but not a penny\nfor studying child psychology. This is because kings and bankers\nsurmised that the discovery of new geographical knowledge would\nenable them to conquer new lands and set up trade empires, whereas\nthey couldn’t see any profit in understanding child psychology.\nIn the 1940s the governments of America and the Soviet Union\nchannelled enormous resources to the study of nuclear physics rather\nthan underwater archaeology.

It’s a question that intrigued\nmany early modern astronomers, particularly after Copernicus argued\nthat the sun, rather than the earth, is located at the centre of the\nuniverse. A number of astronomers and mathematicians tried to\ncalculate the distance, but their methods provided widely varying\nresults. A reliable means of making the measurement was finally\nproposed in the middle of the eighteenth century. Every few years, the\nplanet Venus passes directly between the sun and the earth. The\nduration of the transit differs when seen from distant points on the\nearths surface because of the tiny difference in the angle at which the\nobserver sees it. If several observations of the same transit were made\nfrom different continents, simple trigonometry was all it would take to\ncalculate our exact distance from the sun.\nAstronomers predicted that the next Venus transits would occur in\n1761 and 1769. So expeditions were sent from Europe to the four\ncorners of the world in order to observe the transits from as many\ndistant points as possible. In 1761 scientists observed the transit from\nSiberia, North America, Madagascar and South Africa. As the 1769\ntransit approached, the European scientific community mounted a\nsupreme effort, and scientists were dispatched as far as northern Canada\nand California (which was then a wilderness).

The team also\nincluded artists assigned to produce drawings of the new lands, plants,\nanimals and peoples that the scientists would no doubt encounter.\nEquipped with the most advanced scientific instruments that Banks and\nthe Royal Society could buy, the expedition was placed under the\ncommand of Captain James Cook, an experienced seaman as well as an\naccomplished geographer and ethnographer.\nThe expedition left England in 1768, observed the Venus transit from\nTahiti in 1769, reconnoitred several Pacific islands, visited Australia and\nNew Zealand, and returned to England in 1771. It brought back\nenormous quantities of astronomical, geographical, meteorological,\nbotanical, zoological and anthropological data. Its findings made major\ncontributions to a number of disciplines, sparked the imagination of\nEuropeans with astonishing tales of the South Pacific, and inspired\nfuture generations of naturalists and astronomers.\nOne of the fields that benefited from the Cook expedition was\nmedicine. At the time, ships that set sail to distant shores knew that\nmore than half their crew members would die on the journey. The\nnemesis was not angry natives, enemy warships or homesickness.

No one\nknew what caused it, and no matter what remedy was tried, sailors\ncontinued to die in droves. The turning point came in 1747, when a\nBritish physician, James Lind, conducted a controlled experiment on\nsailors who suffered from the disease. He separated them into several\ngroups and gave each group a different treatment. One of the test groups\nwas instructed to eat citrus fruits, a common folk remedy for scurvy.

He resolved to prove the doctor right. He loaded his boat with\na large quantity of sauerkraut and ordered his sailors to eat lots of fresh\nfruits and vegetables whenever the expedition made landfall. Cook did\nnot lose a single sailor to scurvy. In the following decades, all the\nworld’s navies adopted Cook’s nautical diet, and the lives of countless\nsailors and passengers were saved.1\nHowever, the Cook expedition had another, far less benign result.\nCook was not only an experienced seaman and geographer, but also a\nnaval officer. The Royal Society financed a large part of the expedition’s\nexpenses, but the ship itself was provided by the Royal Navy.

The Waldseemüller map became very popular and was copied\nby many other cartographers, spreading the name he had given the new\nland. There is poetic justice in the fact that a quarter of the world, and\ntwo of its seven continents, are named after a little-known Italian whose\nsole claim to fame is that he had the courage to say, ‘We don’t know.’\nThe discovery of America was the foundational event of the Scientific\nRevolution. It not only taught Europeans to favour present observations\nover past traditions, but the desire to conquer America also obliged\nEuropeans to search for new knowledge at breakneck speed. If they\nreally wanted to control the vast new territories, they had to gather\nenormous amounts of new data about the geography, climate, flora,\nfauna, languages, cultures and history of the new continent. Christian\nScriptures, old geography books and ancient oral traditions were of little\nhelp.\nHenceforth not only European geographers, but European scholars in\nalmost all other fields of knowledge began to draw maps with spaces left\nto fill in.

And not just any race, but a master race of\ntall, light-haired, blue-eyed, hard-working, and super-rational humans\nwho emerged from the mists of the north to lay the foundations of\nculture throughout the world. Regrettably, the Aryans who invaded\nIndia and Persia intermarried with the local natives they found in these\nlands, losing their light complexions and blond hair, and with them their\nrationality and diligence. The civilisations of India and Persia\nconsequently declined. In Europe, on the other hand, the Aryans\npreserved their racial purity. This is why Europeans had managed to\nconquer the world, and why they were fit to rule it – provided they took\nprecautions not to mix with inferior races.\nSuch racist theories, prominent and respectable for many decades,\nhave become anathema among scientists and politicians alike.

In 1500, global\nproduction of goods and services was equal to about $250 billion; today\nit hovers around $60 trillion.

Credit enables us to build the present at the\nexpense of the future. It’s founded on the assumption that our future\nresources are sure to be far more abundant than our present resources. A\nhost of new and wonderful opportunities open up if we can build things\nin the present using future income.\nIf credit is such a wonderful thing, why did nobody think of it earlier? Of\ncourse they did. Credit arrangements of one kind or another have existed\nin all known human cultures, going back at least to ancient Sumer. The\nproblem in previous eras was not that no one had the idea or knew how\nto use it. It was that people seldom wanted to extend much credit\nbecause they didn’t trust that the future would be better than the\npresent. They generally believed that times past had been better than\ntheir own times and that the future would be worse, or at best much the\nsame. To put that in economic terms, they believed that the total amount\nof wealth was limited, if not dwindling.

In\nthe eighth chapter of its first volume, Smith made the following novel\nargument: when a landlord, a weaver, or a shoemaker has greater profits\nthan he needs to maintain his own family, he uses the surplus to employ\nmore assistants, in order to further increase his profits. The more profits\nhe has, the more assistants he can employ. It follows that an increase in\nthe profits of private entrepreneurs is the basis for the increase in\ncollective wealth and prosperity.\nThis may not strike you as very original, because we all live in a\ncapitalist world that takes Smith’s argument for granted. We hear\nvariations on this theme every day in the news. Yet Smith’s claim that\nthe selfish human urge to increase private profits is the basis for\ncollective wealth is one of the most revolutionary ideas in human history\n– revolutionary not just from an economic perspective, but even more so\nfrom a moral and political perspective. What Smith says is, in fact, that\ngreed is good, and that by becoming richer I benefit everybody, not just\nmyself. Egoism is altruism.\nSmith taught people to think about the economy as a ‘win-win\nsituation’, in which my profits are also your profits.

If I am rich, you too\nwill be enriched since you can now sell me something. Smith denied the\ntraditional contradiction between wealth and morality, and threw open\nthe gates of heaven for the rich. Being rich meant being moral. In Smiths\nstory, people become rich not by despoiling their neighbours, but by\nincreasing the overall size of the pie. And when the pie grows, everyone\nbenefits. The rich are accordingly the most useful and benevolent people\nin society, because they turn the wheels of growth for everyone’s\nadvantage.\nAll this depends, however, on the rich using their profits to open new\nfactories and hire new employees, rather than wasting them on non-\nproductive activities. Smith therefore repeated like a mantra the maxim\nthat ‘When profits increase, the landlord or weaver will employ more\nassistants’ and not ‘When profits increase, Scrooge will hoard his money\nin a chest and take it out only to count his coins.’ A crucial part of the\nmodern capitalist economy was the emergence of a new ethic, according\nto which profits ought to be reinvested in production. This brings about\nmore profits, which are again reinvested in production, which brings\nmore profits, et cetera ad infinitum. Investments can be made in many\nways: enlarging the factory, conducting scientific research, developing\nnew products. Yet all these investments must somehow increase\nproduction and translate into larger profits. In the new capitalist creed,\nthe first and most sacred commandment is: ‘The profits of production\nmust be reinvested in increasing production.’\nThat’s why capitalism is called ‘capitalism’. Capitalism distinguishes\n‘capital’ from mere ‘wealth’. Capital consists of money, goods and\nresources that are invested in production. Wealth, on the other hand, is\nburied in the ground or wasted on unproductive activities. A pharaoh\nwho pours resources into a non-productive pyramid is not a capitalist. A\npirate who loots a Spanish treasure fleet and buries a chest full of\nglittering coins on the beach of some Caribbean island is not a capitalist.\nBut a hard-working factory hand who reinvests part of his income in the\nstock market is.\nThe idea that ‘The profits of production must be reinvested in\nincreasing production’ sounds trivial.

Another government might prefer to\ninvest in education, on the grounds that educated people form the basis\nfor the lucrative high-tech industries, which pay lots of taxes without\nneeding extensive port facilities.\nCapitalism began as a theory about how the economy functions. It was\nboth descriptive and prescriptive – it offered an account of how money\nworked and promoted the idea that reinvesting profits in production\nleads to fast economic growth. But capitalism gradually became far more\nthan just an economic doctrine. It now encompasses an ethic – a set of\nteachings about how people should behave, educate their children and\neven think. Its principal tenet is that economic growth is the supreme\ngood, or at least a proxy for the supreme good, because justice, freedom\nand even happiness all depend on economic growth. Ask a capitalist how\nto bring justice and political freedom to a place like Zimbabwe or\nAfghanistan, and you are likely to get a lecture on how economic\naffluence and a thriving middle class are essential for stable democratic\ninstitutions, and about the need therefore to inculcate Afghan tribesmen\nin the values of free enterprise, thrift and self-reliance.\nThis new religion has had a decisive influence on the development of\nmodern science, too.

Merchants and bankers in the\nmarkets of Istanbul, Isfahan, Delhi and Beijing may have thought along\ncapitalist lines, but the kings and generals in the palaces and forts\ntended to despise merchants and mercantile thinking. Most non-\nEuropean empires of the early modern era were established by great\nconquerors such as Nurhaci and Nader Shah, or by bureaucratic and\nmilitary elites as in the Qing and Ottoman empires. Financing wars\nthrough taxes and plunder (without making fine distinctions between the\ntwo), they owed little to credit systems, and they cared even less about\nthe interests of bankers and investors.\nIn Europe, on the other hand, kings and generals gradually adopted\nthe mercantile way of thinking, until merchants and bankers became the\nruling elite. The European conquest of the world was increasingly\nfinanced through credit rather than taxes, and was increasingly directed\nby capitalists whose main ambition was to receive maximum returns on\ntheir investments. The empires built by bankers and merchants in frock\ncoats and top hats defeated the empires built by kings and noblemen in\ngold clothes and shining armour. The mercantile empires were simply\nmuch shrewder in financing their conquests. Nobody wants to pay taxes,\nbut everyone is happy to invest.\nIn 1484 Christopher Columbus approached the king of Portugal with\nthe proposal that he finance a fleet that would sail westward to find a\nnew trade route to East Asia. Such explorations were a very risky and\ncostly business. A lot of money was needed in order to build ships, buy\nsupplies, and pay sailors and soldiers – and there was no guarantee that\nthe investment would yield a return. The king of Portugal declined.\nLike a present-day start-up entrepreneur, Columbus did not give up.\nHe pitched his idea to other potential investors in Italy, France, England,\nand again in Portugal. Each time he was rejected. He then tried his luck\nwith Ferdinand and Isabella, rulers of newly united Spain. He took on\nsome experienced lobbyists, and with their help he managed to convince\nQueen Isabella to invest. As every school-child knows, Isabella hit the\njackpot.

This was\nthe magic circle of imperial capitalism: credit financed new discoveries;\ndiscoveries led to colonies; colonies provided profits; profits built trust;\nand trust translated into more credit. Nurhaci and Nader Shah ran out of\nfuel after a few thousand kilometres. Capitalist entrepreneurs only\nincreased their financial momentum from conquest to conquest.\nBut these expeditions remained chancy affairs, so credit markets\nnevertheless remained quite cautious. Many expeditions returned to\nEurope empty-handed, having discovered nothing of value. The English,\nfor instance, wasted a lot of capital in fruitless attempts to discover a\nnorth-western passage to Asia through the Arctic. Many other\nexpeditions didn’t return at all. Ships hit icebergs, foundered in tropical\nstorms, or fell victim to pirates. In order to increase the number of\npotential investors and reduce the risk they incurred, Europeans turned\nto limited liability joint-stock companies. Instead of a single investor\nbetting all his money on a single rickety ship, the joint-stock company\ncollected money from a large number of investors, each risking only a\nsmall portion of his capital.

The Dutch burghers, who had\nlittle taste for combat on land, hired mercenary armies to fight the\nSpanish for them. The Dutch themselves meanwhile took to the sea in\never-larger fleets. Mercenary armies and cannon-brandishing fleets cost a\nfortune, but the Dutch were able to finance their military expeditions\nmore easily than the mighty Spanish Empire because they secured the\ntrust of the burgeoning European financial system at a time when the\nSpanish king was carelessly eroding its trust in him. Financiers extended\nthe Dutch enough credit to set up armies and fleets, and these armies\nand fleets gave the Dutch control of world trade routes, which in turn\nyielded handsome profits. The profits allowed the Dutch to repay the\nloans, which strengthened the trust of the financiers. Amsterdam was\nfast becoming not only one of the most important ports of Europe, but\nalso the continent’s financial Mecca.\nHow exactly did the Dutch win the trust of the financial system? Firstly,\nthey were sticklers about repaying their loans on time and in full,\nmaking the extension of credit less risky for lenders. Secondly, their\ncountry’s judicial system enjoyed independence and protected private\nrights – in particular private property rights. Capital trickles away from\ndictatorial states that fail to defend private individuals and their\nproperty. Instead, it flows into states upholding the rule of law and\nprivate property.\nImagine that you are the son of a solid family of German financiers.\nYour father sees an opportunity to expand the business by opening\nbranches in major European cities.

Louis XV found it more and more difficult to\nraise credit. This became one of the chief reasons that the overseas\nFrench Empire fell into British hands. While the British could borrow\nmoney easily and at low interest rates, France had difficulties securing\nloans, and had to pay high interest on them.

Eventually, in the 1780s, Louis XVI,\nwho had ascended to the throne on his grandfather’s death, realised that\nhalf his annual budget was tied to servicing the interest on his loans, and\nthat he was heading towards bankruptcy.

On the contrary, the connection only grew stronger during the\nnineteenth century. Joint-stock companies no longer needed to establish\nand govern private colonies – their managers and large shareholders\nnow pulled the strings of power in London, Amsterdam and Paris, and\nthey could count on the state to look after their interests. As Marx and\nother social critics quipped, Western governments were becoming a\ncapitalist trade union.\nThe most notorious example of how governments did the bidding of\nbig money was the First Opium War, fought between Britain and China\n(1840–42). In the first half of the nineteenth century, the British East\nIndia Company and sundry British business people made fortunes by\nexporting drugs, particularly opium, to China.

Credit ratings\nindicate the probability that a country will pay its debts. In addition to\npurely economic data, they take into account political, social and even\ncultural factors. An oil-rich country cursed with a despotic government,\nendemic warfare and a corrupt judicial system will usually receive a low\ncredit rating. As a result, it is likely to remain relatively poor since it will\nnot be able to raise the necessary capital to make the most of its oil\nbounty. A country devoid of natural resources, but which enjoys peace, a\nfair judicial system and a free government is likely to receive a high\ncredit rating. As such, it may be able to raise enough cheap capital to\nsupport a good education system and foster a flourishing high-tech\nindustry.\nThe Cult of the Free Market\nCapital and politics influence each other to such an extent that their\nrelations are hotly debated by economists, politicians and the general\npublic alike. Ardent capitalists tend to argue that capital should be free\nto influence politics, but politics should not be allowed to influence\ncapital. They argue that when governments interfere in the markets,\npolitical interests cause them to make unwise investments that result in\nslower growth. For example, a government may impose heavy taxation\non industrialists and use the money to give lavish unemployment\nbenefits, which are popular with voters. In the view of many business\npeople, it would be far better if the government left the money with\nthem.

At the end of the Middle\nAges, slavery was almost unknown in Christian Europe.

Unrestrained market forces, rather\nthan tyrannical kings or racist ideologues, were responsible for this\ncalamity.\nWhen the Europeans conquered America, they opened gold and silver\nmines and established sugar, tobacco and cotton plantations. These\nmines and plantations became the mainstay of American production and\nexport. The sugar plantations were particularly important. In the Middle\nAges, sugar was a rare luxury in Europe. It was imported from the\nMiddle East at prohibitive prices and used sparingly as a secret\ningredient in delicacies and snake-oil medicines. After large sugar\nplantations were established in America, ever-increasing amounts of\nsugar began to reach Europe. The price of sugar dropped and Europe\ndeveloped an insatiable sweet tooth. Entrepreneurs met this need by\nproducing huge quantities of sweets: cakes, cookies, chocolate, candy,\nand sweetened beverages such as cocoa, coffee and tea. The annual\nsugar intake of the average Englishman rose from near zero in the early\nseventeenth century to around eight kilograms in the early nineteenth\ncentury.\nHowever, growing cane and extracting its sugar was a labour-intensive\nbusiness. Few people wanted to work long hours in malaria-infested\nsugar fields under a tropical sun. Contract labourers would have\nproduced a commodity too expensive for mass consumption. Sensitive to\nmarket forces, and greedy for profits and economic growth, European\nplantation owners switched to slaves.\nFrom the sixteenth to the nineteenth centuries, about 10 million\nAfrican slaves were imported to America.

It was\na purely economic enterprise, organised and financed by the free market\naccording to the laws of supply and demand. Private slave-trading\ncompanies sold shares on the Amsterdam, London and Paris stock\nexchanges. Middle-class Europeans looking for a good investment bought\nthese shares. Relying on this money, the companies bought ships, hired\nsailors and soldiers, purchased slaves in Africa, and transported them to\nAmerica. There they sold the slaves to the plantation owners, using the\nproceeds to purchase plantation products such as sugar, cocoa, coffee,\ntobacco, cotton and rum. They returned to Europe, sold the sugar and\ncotton for a good price, and then sailed to Africa to begin another round.\nThe shareholders were very pleased with this arrangement. Throughout\nthe eighteenth century the yield on slave-trade investments was about 6\nper cent a year – they were extremely profitable, as any modern\nconsultant would be quick to admit.\nThis is the fly in the ointment of free-market capitalism.

The economic pie of 2014 is far larger than the pie of 1500,\nbut it is distributed so unevenly that many African peasants and\nIndonesian labourers return home after a hard day’s work with less food\nthan did their ancestors 500 years ago. Much like the Agricultural\nRevolution, so too the growth of the modern economy might turn out to\nbe a colossal fraud. The human species and the global economy may well\nkeep growing, but many more individuals may live in hunger and want.\nCapitalism has two answers to this criticism. First, capitalism has\ncreated a world that nobody but a capitalist is capable of running. The\nonly serious attempt to manage the world differently – Communism –\nwas so much worse in almost every conceivable way that nobody has the\nstomach to try again. In 8500 one could cry bitter tears over the\nBC\nAgricultural Revolution, but it was too late to give up agriculture.\nSimilarly, we may not like capitalism, but we cannot live without it.\nThe second answer is that we just need more patience – paradise, the\ncapitalists promise, is right around the corner. True, mistakes have been\nmade, such as the Atlantic slave trade and the exploitation of the\nEuropean working class. But we have learned our lesson, and if we just\nwait a little longer and allow the pie to grow a little bigger, everybody\nwill receive a fatter slice. The division of spoils will never be equitable,\nbut there will be enough to satisfy every man, woman and child – even\nin the Congo.\nThere are, indeed, some positive signs. At least when we use purely\nmaterial criteria – such as life expectancy, child mortality and calorie\nintake – the standard of living of the average human in 2014 is\nsignificantly higher than it was in 1914, despite the exponential growth\nin the number of humans.\nYet can the economic pie grow indefinitely? Every pie requires raw\nmaterials and energy. Prophets of doom warn that sooner or later Homo\nsapiens will exhaust the raw materials and energy of planet Earth. And\nwhat will happen then?"

Yet that does not suffice. Economic growth also requires\nenergy and raw materials, and these are finite. When and if they run out,\nthe entire system will collapse.\nBut the evidence provided by the past is that they are finite only in\ntheory. Counter-intuitively, while humankind’s use of energy and raw\nmaterials has mushroomed in the last few centuries, the amounts\navailable for our exploitation have actually increased. Whenever a\nshortage of either has threatened to slow economic growth, investments\nhave flowed into scientific and technological research. These have\ninvariably produced not only more efficient ways of exploiting existing\nresources, but also completely new types of energy and materials.\nConsider the vehicle industry. Over the last 300 years, humankind has\nmanufactured billions of vehicles – from carts and wheelbarrows, to\ntrains, cars, supersonic jets and space shuttles. One might have expected\nthat such a prodigious effort would have exhausted the energy sources\nand raw materials available for vehicle production, and that today we\nwould be scraping the bottom of the barrel. Yet the opposite is the case.\nWhereas in 1700 the global vehicle industry relied overwhelmingly on\nwood and iron, today it has at its disposal a cornucopia of new-found\nmaterials such as plastic, rubber, aluminium and titanium, none of\nwhich our ancestors even knew about.

We call it the Industrial\nRevolution.\nFor millennia prior to the Industrial Revolution, humans already knew\nhow to make use of a large variety of energy sources. They burned wood\nin order to smelt iron, heat houses and bake cakes. Sailing ships\nharnessed wind power to move around, and watermills captured the\nflow of rivers to grind grain. Yet all these had clear limits and problems.\nTrees were not available everywhere, the wind didn’t always blow when\nyou needed it, and water power was only useful if you lived near a river.\nAn even bigger problem was that people didn’t know how to convert\none type of energy into another. They could harness the movement of\nwind and water to sail ships and push millstones, but not to heat water\nor smelt iron. Conversely, they could not use the heat energy produced\nby burning wood to make a millstone move. Humans had only one\nmachine capable of performing such energy conversion tricks: the body.\nIn the natural process of metabolism, the bodies of humans and other\nanimals burn organic fuels known as food and convert the released\nenergy into the movement of muscles. Men, women and beasts could\nconsume grain and meat, burn up their carbohydrates and fats, and use\nthe energy to haul a rickshaw or pull a plough.\nSince human and animal bodies were the only energy conversion\ndevice available, muscle power was the key to almost all human\nactivities. Human muscles built carts and houses, ox muscles ploughed\nfields, and horse muscles transported goods. The energy that fuelled\nthese organic muscle-machines came ultimately from a single source –\nplants. Plants in their turn obtained their energy from the sun. By the\nprocess of photosynthesis, they captured solar energy and packed it into\norganic compounds. Almost everything people did throughout history\nwas fuelled by solar energy that was captured by plants and converted\ninto muscle power.\nHuman history was consequently dominated by two main cycles: the\ngrowth cycles of plants and the changing cycles of solar energy (day and\nnight, summer and winter). When sunlight was scarce and when wheat\nfields were still green, humans had little energy. Granaries were empty,"

When the sun shone brightly and the\nwheat ripened, peasants harvested the crops and filled the granaries. Tax\ncollectors hurried to take their share. Soldiers flexed their muscles and\nsharpened their swords. Kings convened councils and planned their next\ncampaigns. Everyone was fuelled by solar energy – captured and\npackaged in wheat, rice and potatoes.\nThe Secret in the Kitchen\nThroughout these long millennia, day in and day out, people stood face\nto face with the most important invention in the history of energy\nproduction – and failed to notice it. It stared them in the eye every time\na housewife or servant put up a kettle to boil water for tea or put a pot\nfull of potatoes on the stove. The minute the water boiled, the lid of the\nkettle or the pot jumped. Heat was being converted to movement. But\njumping pot lids were an annoyance, especially if you forgot the pot on\nthe stove and the water boiled over. Nobody saw their real potential.\nA partial breakthrough in converting heat into movement followed the\ninvention of gunpowder in ninth-century China. At first, the idea of\nusing gunpowder to propel projectiles was so counter-intuitive that for\ncenturies gunpowder was used primarily to produce fire bombs. But\neventually – perhaps after some bomb expert ground gunpowder in a\nmortar only to have the pestle shoot out with force – guns made their\nappearance. About 600 years passed between the invention of\ngunpowder and the development of effective artillery.\nEven then, the idea of converting heat into motion remained so\ncounter-intuitive that another three centuries went by before people\ninvented the next machine that used heat to move things around. The\nnew technology was born in British coal mines. As the British population\nswelled, forests were cut down to fuel the growing economy and make\nway for houses and fields. Britain suffered from an increasing shortage of\nfirewood. It began burning coal as a substitute. Many coal seams were\nlocated in waterlogged areas, and flooding prevented miners from\naccessing the lower strata of the mines. It was a problem looking for a"

That noise – harbinger of the Industrial Revolution –\nwas subtle at first, but it grew louder and louder with each passing\ndecade until it enveloped the entire world in a deafening cacophony. It\nemanated from a steam engine.\nThere are many types of steam engines, but they all share one\ncommon principle. You burn some kind of fuel, such as coal, and use the\nresulting heat to boil water, producing steam. As the steam expands it\npushes a piston. The piston moves, and anything that is connected to the\npiston moves with it. You have converted heat into movement! In\neighteenth-century British coal mines, the piston was connected to a\npump that extracted water from the bottom of the mineshafts. The\nearliest engines were incredibly inefficient. You needed to burn a huge\nload of coal in order to pump out even a tiny amount of water. But in\nthe mines coal was plentiful and close at hand, so nobody cared.\nIn the decades that followed, British entrepreneurs improved the\nefficiency of the steam engine, brought it out of the mineshafts, and\nconnected it to looms and gins. This revolutionised textile production,\nmaking it possible to produce ever-larger quantities of cheap textiles. In\nthe blink of an eye, Britain became the workshop of the world. But even\nmore importantly, getting the steam engine out of the mines broke an\nimportant psychological barrier. If you could burn coal in order to move\ntextile looms, why not use the same method to move other things, such\nas vehicles?\nIn 1825, a British engineer connected a steam engine to a train of\nmine wagons full of coal. The engine drew the wagons along an iron rail\nsome twenty kilometres long from the mine to the nearest harbour. This\nwas the first steam-powered locomotive in history. Clearly, if steam\ncould be used to transport coal, why not other goods? And why not even\npeople? On 15 September 1830, the first commercial railway line was\nopened, connecting Liverpool with Manchester. The trains moved under\nthe same steam power that had previously pumped water and moved\ntextile looms. A mere twenty years later, Britain had tens of thousands of\nkilometres of railway tracks.1\nHenceforth, people became obsessed with the idea that machines and\nengines could be used to convert one type of energy into another. Any\ntype of energy, anywhere in the world, might be harnessed to whatever"

Six hundred years passed between the moment Chinese\nalchemists discovered gunpowder and the moment Turkish cannon\npulverised the walls of Constantinople. Only forty years passed between\nthe moment Einstein determined that any kind of mass could be\nconverted into energy – that’s what E = mc2 means – and the moment\natom bombs obliterated Hiroshima and Nagasaki and nuclear power\nstations mushroomed all over the globe.\nAnother crucial discovery was the internal combustion engine, which\ntook little more than a generation to revolutionise human transportation\nand turn petroleum into liquid political power.

All we lack is the knowledge\nnecessary to harness and convert it to our needs. The amount of energy\nstored in all the fossil fuel on earth is negligible compared to the amount\nthat the sun dispenses every day, free of charge. Only a tiny proportion\nof the sun’s energy reaches us, yet it amounts to 3,766,800 exajoules of\nenergy each year (a joule is a unit of energy in the metric system, about\nthe amount you expend to lift a small apple one yard straight up; an\nexajoule is a billion billion joules – that’s a lot of apples).2 All the\nworld’s plants capture only about 3,000 of those solar exajoules through\nthe process of photosynthesis.3 All human activities and industries put\ntogether consume about 500 exajoules annually, equivalent to the\namount of energy earth receives from the sun in just ninety minutes.4\nAnd that’s only solar energy.

From an objective perspective, this calf no longer needs\neither maternal bonding or playmates in order to survive and reproduce.\nBut from a subjective perspective, the calf still feels a very strong urge to\nbond with her mother and to play with other calves. If these urges are\nnot fulfilled, the calf suffers greatly. This is the basic lesson of\nevolutionary psychology: a need shaped in the wild continues to be felt\nsubjectively even if it is no longer really necessary for survival and\nreproduction. The tragedy of industrial agriculture is that it takes great\ncare of the objective needs of animals, while neglecting their subjective\nneeds.\nThe truth of this theory has been known at least since the 1950s, when\nthe American psychologist Harry Harlow studied the development of\nmonkeys. Harlow separated infant monkeys from their mothers several\nhours after birth. The monkeys were isolated inside cages, and then\nraised by dummy mothers.

When the\ntwo mothers were placed in close proximity, the infants held on to the\ncloth mother even while they reached over to suck milk from the metal\nmother.

These industrial livestock methods have led to a sharp increase\nin agricultural production and in human food reserves. Together with\nthe mechanisation of plant cultivation, industrial animal husbandry is\nthe basis for the entire modern socio-economic order. Before the\nindustrialisation of agriculture, most of the food produced in fields and\nfarms was ‘wasted’ feeding peasants and farmyard animals. Only a small\npercentage was available to feed artisans, teachers, priests and\nbureaucrats. Consequently, in almost all societies peasants comprised\nmore than 90 per cent of the population.

Instead of eating little, which will lead to economic\ncontraction, people eat too much and then buy diet products –\ncontributing to economic growth twice over.\nHow can we square the consumerist ethic with the capitalist ethic of the\nbusiness person, according to which profits should not be wasted, and\nshould instead be reinvested in production? It’s simple. As in previous\neras, there is today a division of labour between the elite and the masses.\nIn medieval Europe, aristocrats spent their money carelessly on\nextravagant luxuries, whereas peasants lived frugally, minding every\npenny. Today, the tables have turned. The rich take great care managing\ntheir assets and investments, while the less well heeled go into debt\nbuying cars and televisions they don’t really need.\nThe capitalist and consumerist ethics are two sides of the same coin, a\nmerger of two commandments. The supreme commandment of the rich\nis ‘Invest!’ The supreme commandment of the rest of us is ‘Buy!’"

Humans cut down forests,\ndrained swamps, dammed rivers, flooded plains, laid down tens of\nthousands of kilometres of railroad tracks, and built skyscraping\nmetropolises. As the world was moulded to fit the needs of Homo sapiens,\nhabitats were destroyed and species went extinct. Our once green and\nblue planet is becoming a concrete and plastic shopping centre.\nToday, the earths continents are home to almost 7 billion Sapiens. If\nyou took all these people and put them on a large set of scales, their\ncombined mass would be about 300 million tons. If you then took all our\ndomesticated farmyard animals – cows, pigs, sheep and chickens – and\nplaced them on an even larger set of scales, their mass would amount to\nabout 700 million tons. In contrast, the combined mass of all surviving\nlarge wild animals – from porcupines and penguins to elephants and\nwhales – is less than 100 million tons. Our children’s books, our\niconography and our TV screens are still full of giraffes, wolves and\nchimpanzees, but the real world has very few of them left. There are\nabout 80,000 giraffes in the world, compared to 1.5 billion cattle; only\n200,000 wolves, compared to 400 million domesticated dogs; only\n250,000 chimpanzees – in contrast to billions of humans.

The\nfuture may see Sapiens gaining control of a cornucopia of new materials\nand energy sources, while simultaneously destroying what remains of\nthe natural habitat and driving most other species to extinction.\nIn fact, ecological turmoil might endanger the survival of Homo sapiens\nitself. Global warming, rising oceans and widespread pollution could\nmake the earth less hospitable to our kind, and the future might\nconsequently see a spiralling race between human power and human-\ninduced natural disasters. As humans use their power to counter the\nforces of nature and subjugate the ecosystem to their needs and whims,\nthey might cause more and more unanticipated and dangerous side\neffects. These are likely to be controllable only by even more drastic\nmanipulations of the ecosystem, which would result in even worse\nchaos.\nMany call this process ‘the destruction of nature’. But it’s not really\ndestruction, it’s change. Nature cannot be destroyed. Sixty-five million\nyears ago, an asteroid wiped out the dinosaurs, but in so doing opened\nthe way forward for mammals. Today, humankind is driving many\nspecies into extinction and might even annihilate itself. But other\norganisms are doing quite well. Rats and cockroaches, for example, are\nin their heyday. These tenacious creatures would probably creep out\nfrom beneath the smoking rubble of a nuclear Armageddon, ready and\nable to spread their DNA. Perhaps 65 million years from now, intelligent\nrats will look back gratefully on the decimation wrought by humankind,\njust as we today can thank that dinosaur-busting asteroid.\nStill, the rumours of our own extinction are premature.

The Industrial Revolution opened the\nway to a long line of experiments in social engineering and an even\nlonger series of unpremeditated changes in daily life and human\nmentality. One example among many is the replacement of the rhythms\nof traditional agriculture with the uniform and precise schedule of\nindustry.\nTraditional agriculture depended on cycles of natural time and organic\ngrowth. Most societies were unable to make precise time measurements,\nnor were they terribly interested in doing so. The world went about its\nbusiness without clocks and timetables, subject only to the movements\nof the sun and the growth cycles of plants. There was no uniform\nworking day, and all routines changed drastically from season to season.\nPeople knew where the sun was, and watched anxiously for portents of\nthe rainy season and harvest time, but they did not know the hour and\nhardly cared about the year. If a lost time traveller popped up in a\nmedieval village and asked a passerby, ‘What year is this?’ the villager\nwould be as bewildered by the question as by the strangers ridiculous\nclothing.\nIn contrast to medieval peasants and shoemakers, modern industry\ncares little about the sun or the season. It sanctifies precision and\nuniformity. For example, in a medieval workshop each shoemaker made\nan entire shoe, from sole to buckle. If one shoemaker was late for work,\nit did not stall the others. However, in a modern footwear-factory\nassembly line, every worker mans a machine that produces just a small\npart of a shoe, which is then passed on to the next machine. If the\nworker who operates machine no. 5 has overslept, it stalls all the other\nmachines. In order to prevent such calamities, everybody must adhere to\na precise timetable. Each worker arrives at work at exactly the same\ntime. Everybody takes their lunch break together, whether they are\nhungry or not. Everybody goes home when a whistle announces that the\nshift is over – not when they have finished their project."

Even in places devoid of assembly lines and machines,\nthe timetable became king. If the shift at the factory ends at 5 p.m., the\nlocal pub had better be open for business by 5:02.\nA crucial link in the spreading timetable system was public\ntransportation. If workers needed to start their shift by 08:00, the train\nor bus had to reach the factory gate by 07:55. A few minutes’ delay\nwould lower production and perhaps even lead to the lay-offs of the\nunfortunate latecomers. In 1784 a carriage service with a published\nschedule began operating in Britain. Its timetable specified only the hour\nof departure, not arrival. Back then, each British city and town had its\nown local time, which could differ from London time by up to half an\nhour. When it was 12:00 in London, it was perhaps 12:20 in Liverpool\nand 11:50 in Canterbury. Since there were no telephones, no radio or\ntelevision, and no fast trains – who could know, and who cared?2"

The trains were much faster than the old carriages, so the quirky\ndifferences in local hours became a severe nuisance. In 1847, British\ntrain companies put their heads together and agreed that henceforth all\ntrain timetables would be calibrated to Greenwich Observatory time,\nrather than the local times of Liverpool, Manchester or Glasgow. More\nand more institutions followed the lead of the train companies. Finally,\nin 1880, the British government took the unprecedented step of\nlegislating that all timetables in Britain must follow Greenwich. For the\nfirst time in history, a country adopted a national time and obliged its\npopulation to live according to an artificial clock rather than local ones\nor sunrise-to-sunset cycles.\nThis modest beginning spawned a global network of timetables,\nsynchronised down to the tiniest fractions of a second. When the\nbroadcast media – first radio, then television – made their debut, they\nentered a world of timetables and became its main enforcers and\nevangelists. Among the first things radio stations broadcast were time\nsignals, beeps that enabled far-flung settlements and ships at sea to set\ntheir clocks. Later, radio stations adopted the custom of broadcasting the\nnews every hour. Nowadays, the first item of every news broadcast –\nmore important even than the outbreak of war – is the time. During\nWorld War Two, BBC News was broadcast to Nazi-occupied Europe.\nEach news programme opened with a live broadcast of Big Ben tolling\nthe hour – the magical sound of freedom. Ingenious German physicists\nfound a way to determine the weather conditions in London based on\ntiny differences in the tone of the broadcast ding-dongs. This\ninformation offered invaluable help to the Luftwaffe. When the British\nSecret Service discovered this, they replaced the live broadcast with a set\nrecording of the famous clock.\nIn order to run the timetable network, cheap but precise portable\nclocks became ubiquitous. In Assyrian, Sassanid or Inca cities there\nmight have been at most a few sundials. In European medieval cities\nthere was usually a single clock – a giant machine mounted on top of a\nhigh tower in the town square.

The family was\nalso the welfare system, the health system, the education system, the\nconstruction industry, the trade union, the pension fund, the insurance\ncompany, the radio, the television, the newspapers, the bank and even\nthe police.\nWhen a person fell sick, the family took care of her. When a person\ngrew old, the family supported her, and her children were her pension\nfund. When a person died, the family took care of the orphans. If a\nperson wanted to build a hut, the family lent a hand. If a person wanted\nto open a business, the family raised the necessary money. If a person\nwanted to marry, the family chose, or at least vetted, the prospective\nspouse. If conflict arose with a neighbour, the family muscled in. But if a\nperson’s illness was too grave for the family to manage, or a new\nbusiness demanded too large an investment, or the neighbourhood\nquarrel escalated to the point of violence, the local community came to\nthe rescue.\nThe community offered help on the basis of local traditions and an\neconomy of favours, which often differed greatly from the supply and\ndemand laws of the free market. In an old-fashioned medieval\ncommunity, when my neighbour was in need, I helped build his hut and\nguard his sheep, without expecting any payment in return. When I was\nin need, my neighbour returned the favour. At the same time, the local\npotentate might have drafted all of us villagers to construct his castle\nwithout paying us a penny. In exchange, we counted on him to defend\nus against brigands and barbarians. Village life involved many\ntransactions but few payments.

Most\nhuman needs were taken care of by the family and the community.\nThere were also kingdoms and empires that performed important tasks\nsuch as waging wars, building roads and constructing palaces. For these\npurposes kings raised taxes and occasionally enlisted soldiers and\nlabourers. Yet, with few exceptions, they tended to stay out of the daily\naffairs of families and communities. Even if they wanted to intervene,\nmost kings could do so only with difficulty. Traditional agricultural\neconomies had few surpluses with which to feed crowds of government\nofficials, policemen, social workers, teachers and doctors. Consequently,\nmost rulers did not develop mass welfare systems, health-care systems or\neducational systems. They left such matters in the hands of families and\ncommunities. Even on rare occasions when rulers tried to intervene more\nintensively in the daily lives of the peasantry (as happened, for example,\nin the Qin Empire in China), they did so by converting family heads and\ncommunity elders into government agents.\nOften enough, transportation and communication difficulties made it\nso difficult to intervene in the affairs of remote communities that many\nkingdoms preferred to cede even the most basic royal prerogatives –\nsuch as taxation and violence – to communities. The Ottoman Empire,\nfor instance, allowed family vendettas to mete out justice, rather than\nsupporting a large imperial police force. If my cousin killed somebody,\nthe victim’s brother might kill me in sanctioned revenge. The sultan in\nIstanbul or even the provincial pasha did not intervene in such clashes,\nas long as violence remained within acceptable limits.\nIn the Chinese Ming Empire (1368–1644), the population was\norganised into the baojia system. Ten families were grouped to form a\njia, and ten jia constituted a bao. When a member of a bao commited a\ncrime, other bao members could be punished for it, in particular the bao\nelders. Taxes too were levied on the bao, and it was the responsibility of\nthe bao elders rather than of the state officials to assess the situation of\neach family and determine the amount of tax it should pay. From the\nempire’s perspective, this system had a huge advantage. Instead of\nmaintaining thousands of revenue officials and tax collectors, who would\nhave to monitor the earnings and expenses of every family, these tasks\nwere left to the community elders.

Traditionally, the social order was hard and rigid. ‘Order’ implied\nstability and continuity.

Humans tended to assume that the social structure was\ninflexible and eternal.

People tended to\nreconcile themselves to the status quo, declaring that ‘this is how it\nalways was, and this is how it always will be’.\nOver the last two centuries, the pace of change became so quick that\nthe social order acquired a dynamic and malleable nature. It now exists\nin a state of permanent flux. When we speak of modern revolutions we\ntend to think of 1789 (the French Revolution), 1848 (the liberal\nrevolutions) or 1917 (the Russian Revolution).

In the last two centuries, the currency of\npolitics is that it promises to destroy the old world and build a better\none in its place.

None\nof us was alive a thousand years ago, so we easily forget how much more\nviolent the world used to be. And as wars become more rare they attract\nmore attention. Many more people think about the wars raging today in\nAfghanistan and Iraq than about the peace in which most Brazilians and\nIndians live.\nEven more importantly, it’s easier to relate to the suffering of\nindividuals than of entire populations. However, in order to understand\nmacro-historical processes, we need to examine mass statistics rather\nthan individual stories. In the year 2000, wars caused the deaths of\n310,000 individuals, and violent crime killed another 520,000. Each and\nevery victim is a world destroyed, a family ruined, friends and relatives\nscarred for life. Yet from a macro perspective these 830,000 victims\ncomprised only 1.5 per cent of the 56 million people who died in 2000.\nThat year 1.26 million people died in car accidents (2.25 per cent of\ntotal mortality) and 815,000 people committed suicide (1.45 per cent).4\nThe figures for 2002 are even more surprising. Out of 57 million dead,\nonly 172,000 people died in war and 569,000 died of violent crime (a\ntotal of 741,000 victims of human violence). In contrast, 873,000 people\ncommitted suicide.5 It turns out that in the year following the 9/11\nattacks, despite all the talk of terrorism and war, the average person was\nmore likely to kill himself than to be killed by a terrorist, a soldier or a\ndrug dealer.\nIn most parts of the world, people go to sleep without fearing that in\nthe middle of the night a neighbouring tribe might surround their village\nand slaughter everyone.

(Even today, as the above figures indicate,\nlocal crime is a far deadlier threat than international wars.) As we have\nseen, early farmers, who knew no political organisations larger than the\nlocal community, suffered rampant violence.6 As kingdoms and empires\nbecame stronger, they reined in communities and the level of violence\ndecreased. In the decentralised kingdoms of medieval Europe, about\ntwenty to forty people were murdered each year for every 100,000\ninhabitants. In recent decades, when states and markets have become\nall-powerful and communities have vanished, violence rates have\ndropped even further. Today the global average is only nine murders a\nyear per 100,000 people, and most of these murders take place in weak\nstates such as Somalia and Colombia. In the centralised states of Europe,\nthe average is one murder a year per 100,000 people.7\nThere are certainly cases where states use their power to kill their own\ncitizens, and these often loom large in our memories and fears. During\nthe twentieth century, tens of millions if not hundreds of millions of\npeople were killed by the security forces of their own states. Still, from a\nmacro perspective, state-run courts and police forces have probably\nincreased the level of security worldwide. Even in oppressive\ndictatorships, the average modern person is far less likely to die at the\nhands of another person than in premodern societies. In 1964 a military\ndictatorship was established in Brazil. It ruled the country until 1985.\nDuring these twenty years, several thousand Brazilians were murdered\nby the regime. Thousands more were imprisoned and tortured. Yet even\nin the worst years, the average Brazilian in Rio de Janeiro was far less\nlikely to die at human hands than the average Waorani, Arawete or\nYanomamo. The Waorani, Arawete and Yanomamo are indigenous\npeople who live in the depths of the Amazon forest, without army, police\nor prisons.

Throughout history\nempires have crushed rebellions with an iron fist, and when its day\ncame, a sinking empire used all its might to save itself, usually\ncollapsing into a bloodbath. Its final demise generally led to anarchy and\nwars of succession. Since 1945 most empires have opted for peaceful\nearly retirement. Their process of collapse became relatively swift, calm\nand orderly.\nIn 1945 Britain ruled a quarter of the globe. Thirty years later it ruled\njust a few small islands. In the intervening decades it retreated from\nmost of its colonies in a peaceful and orderly manner. Though in some\nplaces such as Malaya and Kenya the British tried to hang on by force of\narms, in most places they accepted the end of empire with a sigh rather\nthan with a temper tantrum. They focused their efforts not on retaining\npower, but on transferring it as smoothly as possible. At least some of\nthe praise usually heaped on Mahatma Gandhi for his non-violent creed\nis actually owed to the British Empire. Despite many years of bitter and\noften violent struggle, when the end of the Raj came, the Indians did not\nhave to fight the British in the streets of Delhi and Calcutta.

Much of the vaunted material wealth that\nshields us from disease and famine was accumulated at the expense of\nlaboratory monkeys, dairy cows and conveyor-belt chickens. Over the\nlast two centuries tens of billions of them have been subjected to a\nregime of industrial exploitation whose cruelty has no precedent in the\nannals of planet Earth. If we accept a mere tenth of what animal-rights\nactivists are claiming, then modern industrial agriculture might well be\nthe greatest crime in history. When evaluating global happiness, it is\nwrong to count the happiness only of the upper classes, of Europeans or\nof men. Perhaps it is also wrong to consider only the happiness of\nhumans.\nCounting Happiness\nSo far we have discussed happiness as if it were largely a product of\nmaterial factors, such as health, diet and wealth. If people are richer and\nhealthier, then they must also be happier. But is that really so obvious?"

Perhaps people in modern affluent societies suffer\ngreatly from alienation and meaninglessness despite their prosperity.\nAnd perhaps our less well-to-do ancestors found much contentment in\ncommunity, religion and a bond with nature.\nIn recent decades, psychologists and biologists have taken up the\nchallenge of studying scientifically what really makes people happy. Is it\nmoney, family, genetics or perhaps virtue? The first step is to define\nwhat is to be measured. The generally accepted definition of happiness is\n‘subjective well-being’. Happiness, according to this view, is something I\nfeel inside myself, a sense of either immediate pleasure or long-term\ncontentment with the way my life is going. If it’s something felt inside,\nhow can it be measured from outside? Presumably, we can do so by\nasking people to tell us how they feel. So psychologists or biologists who\nwant to assess how happy people feel give them questionnaires to fill out\nand tally the results.\nA typical subjective well-being questionnaire asks interviewees to\ngrade on a scale of zero to ten their agreement with statements such as ‘I\nfeel pleased with the way I am’, ‘I feel that life is very rewarding’, ‘I am\noptimistic about the future’ and ‘Life is good’. The researcher then adds\nup all the answers and calculates the interviewee’s general level of\nsubjective well-being.\nSuch questionnaires are used in order to correlate happiness with\nvarious objective factors. One study might compare a thousand people\nwho earn $100,000 a year with a thousand people who earn $50,000. If\nthe study discovers that the first group has an average subjective well-\nbeing level of 8.7, while the latter has an average of only 7.3, the\nresearcher may reasonably conclude that there is a positive correlation\nbetween wealth and subjective well-being. To put it in simple English,\nmoney brings happiness. The same method can be used to examine\nwhether people living in democracies are happier than people living in\ndictatorships, and whether married people are happier than singles,\ndivorcees or widowers.\nThis provides a grounding for historians, who can examine wealth,\npolitical freedom and divorce rates in the past.

If you are an American single mother earning\n$12,000 a year cleaning houses and you suddenly win $500,000 in the\nlottery, you will probably experience a significant and long-term surge in\nyour subjective well-being. You’ll be able to feed and clothe your\nchildren without sinking further into debt. However, if you’re a top\nexecutive earning $250,000 a year and you win $1 million in the lottery,\nor your company board suddenly decides to double your salary, your\nsurge is likely to last only a few weeks. According to the empirical\nfindings, it’s almost certainly not going to make a big difference to the\nway you feel over the long run. You’ll buy a snazzier car, move into a\npalatial home, get used to drinking Chateau Pétrus instead of California\nCabernet, but it’ll soon all seem routine and unexceptional.\nAnother interesting finding is that illness decreases happiness in the\nshort term, but is a source of long-term distress only if a person’s\ncondition is constantly deteriorating or if the disease involves ongoing\nand debilitating pain. People who are diagnosed with chronic illness\nsuch as diabetes are usually depressed for a while, but if the illness does\nnot get worse they adjust to their new condition and rate their happiness\nas highly as healthy people do. Imagine that Lucy and Luke are middle-\nclass twins, who agree to take part in a subjective well-being study. On\nthe way back from the psychology laboratory, Lucy’s car is hit by a bus,\nleaving Lucy with a number of broken bones and a permanently lame\nleg. Just as the rescue crew is cutting her out of the wreckage, the phone\nrings and Luke shouts that he has won the lottery’s $10,000,000 jackpot.\nTwo years later she’ll be limping and he’ll be a lot richer, but when the\npsychologist comes around for a follow-up study, they are both likely to\ngive the same answers they did on the morning of that fateful day.\nFamily and community seem to have more impact on our happiness"

This holds true irrespective of economic or\neven physical conditions. An impecunious invalid surrounded by a\nloving spouse, a devoted family and a warm community may well feel\nbetter than an alienated billionaire, provided that the invalid’s poverty is\nnot too severe and that his illness is not degenerative or painful.\nThis raises the possibility that the immense improvement in material\nconditions over the last two centuries was offset by the collapse of the\nfamily and the community. If so, the average person might well be no\nhappier today than in 1800. Even the freedom we value so highly may\nbe working against us.

With the individual\nwielding unprecedented power to decide her own path in life, we find it\never harder to make commitments.

If happiness\ndepended only on objective conditions such as wealth, health and social\nrelations, it would have been relatively easy to investigate its history.\nThe finding that it depends on subjective expectations makes the task of\nhistorians far harder. We moderns have an arsenal of tranquillisers and\npainkillers at our disposal, but our expectations of ease and pleasure,\nand our intolerance of inconvenience and discomfort, have increased to\nsuch an extent that we may well suffer from pain more than our\nancestors ever did.\nIt’s hard to accept this line of thinking. The problem is a fallacy of\nreasoning embedded deep in our psyches. When we try to guess or\nimagine how happy other people are now, or how people in the past\nwere, we inevitably imagine ourselves in their shoes. But that won’t\nwork because it pastes our expectations on to the material conditions of\nothers. In modern affluent societies it is customary to take a shower and\nchange your clothes every day. Medieval peasants went without washing\nfor months on end, and hardly ever changed their clothes. The very\nthought of living like that, filthy and reeking to the bone, is abhorrent to\nus. Yet medieval peasants seem not to have minded. They were used to\nthe feel and smell of a long-unlaundered shirt. It’s not that they wanted a\nchange of clothes but couldn’t get it – they had what they wanted. So, at\nleast as far as clothing goes, they were content.\nThat’s not so surprising, when you think of it. After all, our\nchimpanzee cousins seldom wash and never change their clothes. Nor\nare we disgusted by the fact that our pet dogs and cats don’t shower or\nchange their coats daily. We pat, hug and kiss them all the same. Small\nchildren in affluent societies often dislike showering, and it takes them\nyears of education and parental discipline to adopt this supposedly\nattractive custom. It is all a matter of expectations.\nIf happiness is determined by expectations, then two pillars of our\nsociety – mass media and the advertising industry – may unwittingly be\ndepleting the globe’s reservoirs of contentment.

Biologists use the same questionnaires, but correlate\nthe answers people give them with biochemical and genetic factors.\nTheir findings are shocking.\nBiologists hold that our mental and emotional world is governed by\nbiochemical mechanisms shaped by millions of years of evolution. Like\nall other mental states, our subjective well-being is not determined by\nexternal parameters such as salary, social relations or political rights.\nRather, it is determined by a complex system of nerves, neurons,\nsynapses and various biochemical substances such as serotonin,\ndopamine and oxytocin.\nNobody is ever made happy by winning the lottery, buying a house,\ngetting a promotion or even finding true love. People are made happy by\none thing and one thing only – pleasant sensations in their bodies. A\nperson who just won the lottery or found new love and jumps from joy is\nnot really reacting to the money or the lover. She is reacting to various\nhormones coursing through her bloodstream, and to the storm of electric\nsignals flashing between different parts of her brain.\nUnfortunately for all hopes of creating heaven on earth, our internal\nbiochemical system seems to be programmed to keep happiness levels\nrelatively constant. There’s no natural selection for happiness as such – a\nhappy hermit’s genetic line will go extinct as the genes of a pair of\nanxious parents get carried on to the next generation. Happiness and\nmisery play a role in evolution only to the extent that they encourage or\ndiscourage survival and reproduction. Perhaps it’s not surprising, then,\nthat evolution has moulded us to be neither too miserable nor too\nhappy. It enables us to enjoy a momentary rush of pleasant sensations,\nbut these never last for ever. Sooner or later they subside and give place\nto unpleasant sensations.\nFor example, evolution provided pleasant feelings as rewards to males\nwho spread their genes by having sex with fertile females. If sex were\nnot accompanied by such pleasure, few males would bother. At the same\ntime, evolution made sure that these pleasant feelings quickly subsided.\nIf orgasms were to last for ever, the very happy males would die of\nhunger for lack of interest in food, and would not take the trouble to\nlook for additional fertile females.\nSome scholars compare human biochemistry to an air-conditioning\nsystem that keeps the temperature constant, come heatwave or"

On a scale from one to ten, some\npeople are born with a cheerful biochemical system that allows their\nmood to swing between levels six and ten, stabilising with time at eight.\nSuch a person is quite happy even if she lives in an alienating big city,\nloses all her money in a stock-exchange crash and is diagnosed with\ndiabetes. Other people are cursed with a gloomy biochemistry that\nswings between three and seven and stabilises at five.

Most males spend their\nlives toiling, worrying, competing and fighting, instead of enjoying\npeaceful bliss, because their DNA manipulates them for its own selfish\naims.

However,\nstarting from the same insight, Buddhism reaches very different\nconclusions.\nAccording to Buddhism, most people identify happiness with pleasant\nfeelings, while identifying suffering with unpleasant feelings. People\nconsequently ascribe immense importance to what they feel, craving to\nexperience more and more pleasures, while avoiding pain. Whatever we\ndo throughout our lives, whether scratching our leg, fidgeting slightly in\nthe chair, or fighting world wars, we are just trying to get pleasant\nfeelings.\nThe problem, according to Buddhism, is that our feelings are no more\nthan fleeting vibrations, changing every moment, like the ocean waves.\nIf five minutes ago I felt joyful and purposeful, now these feelings are\ngone, and I might well feel sad and dejected. So if I want to experience\npleasant feelings, I have to constantly chase them, while driving away\nthe unpleasant feelings. Even if I succeed, I immediately have to start all\nover again, without ever getting any lasting reward for my troubles.\nWhat is so important about obtaining such ephemeral prizes? Why\nstruggle so hard to achieve something that disappears almost as soon as\nit arises? According to Buddhism, the root of suffering is neither the\nfeeling of pain nor of sadness nor even of meaninglessness. Rather, the\nreal root of suffering is this never-ending and pointless pursuit of\nephemeral feelings, which causes us to be in a constant state of tension,\nrestlessness and dissatisfaction. Due to this pursuit, the mind is never\nsatisfied. Even when experiencing pleasure, it is not content, because it\nfears this feeling might soon disappear, and craves that this feeling\nshould stay and intensify.\nPeople are liberated from suffering not when they experience this or\nthat fleeting pleasure, but rather when they understand the impermanent\nnature of all their feelings, and stop craving them. This is the aim of\nBuddhist meditation practices. In meditation, you are supposed to\nclosely observe your mind and body, witness the ceaseless arising and"

All kinds of feelings go on arising and passing – joy, anger,\nboredom, lust – but once you stop craving particular feelings, you can\njust accept them for what they are. You live in the present moment\ninstead of fantasising about what might have been.\nThe resulting serenity is so profound that those who spend their lives\nin the frenzied pursuit of pleasant feelings can hardly imagine it. It is\nlike a man standing for decades on the seashore, embracing certain\n‘good’ waves and trying to prevent them from disintegrating, while\nsimultaneously pushing back ‘bad’ waves to prevent them from getting\nnear him. Day in, day out, the man stands on the beach, driving himself\ncrazy with this fruitless exercise. Eventually, he sits down on the sand\nand just allows the waves to come and go as they please. How peaceful!\nThis idea is so alien to modern liberal culture that when Western New\nAge movements encountered Buddhist insights, they translated them\ninto liberal terms, thereby turning them on their head. New Age cults\nfrequently argue: ‘Happiness does not depend on external conditions. It\ndepends only on what we feel inside. People should stop pursuing\nexternal achievements such as wealth and status, and connect instead\nwith their inner feelings.’ Or more succinctly, ‘Happiness Begins Within.’\nThis is exactly what biologists argue, but more or less the opposite of\nwhat Buddha said.\nBuddha agreed with modern biology and New Age movements that\nhappiness is independent of external conditions. Yet his more important\nand far more profound insight was that true happiness is also\nindependent of our inner feelings. Indeed, the more significance we give\nour feelings, the more we crave them, and the more we suffer. Buddha’s\nrecommendation was to stop not only the pursuit of external\nachievements, but also the pursuit of inner feelings.\nTo sum up, subjective well-being questionnaires identify our well-being\nwith our subjective feelings, and identify the pursuit of happiness with\nthe pursuit of particular emotional states. In contrast, for many\ntraditional philosophies and religions, such as Buddhism, the key to\nhappiness is to know the truth about yourself – to understand who, or"

They never realise that they\nare not their feelings, and that the relentless pursuit of particular\nfeelings just traps them in misery.\nIf this is so, then our entire understanding of the history of happiness\nmight be misguided. Maybe it isn’t so important whether people’s\nexpectations are fulfilled and whether they enjoy pleasant feelings. The\nmain question is whether people know the truth about themselves. What\nevidence do we have that people today understand this truth any better\nthan ancient foragers or medieval peasants?\nScholars began to study the history of happiness only a few years ago,\nand we are still formulating initial hypotheses and searching for\nappropriate research methods. It’s much too early to adopt rigid\nconclusions and end a debate that’s hardly yet begun. What is important\nis to get to know as many different approaches as possible and to ask the\nright questions.\nMost history books focus on the ideas of great thinkers, the bravery of\nwarriors, the charity of saints and the creativity of artists. They have\nmuch to tell about the weaving and unravelling of social structures,\nabout the rise and fall of empires, about the discovery and spread of\ntechnologies.

We had better start filling it.\n* Paradoxically, while psychological studies of subjective well-being rely on people’s ability to\ndiagnose their happiness correctly, the basic raison d’être of psychotherapy is that people don’t\nreally know themselves and that they sometimes need professional help to free themselves of\nself-destructive behaviours."

Sapiens are subject to the\nsame physical forces, chemical reactions and natural-selection processes\nthat govern all living beings. Natural selection may have provided Homo\nsapiens with a much larger playing field than it has given to any other\norganism, but the field has still had its boundaries. The implication has\nbeen that, no matter what their efforts and achievements, Sapiens are\nincapable of breaking free of their biologically determined limits.\nBut at the dawn of the twenty-first century, this is no longer true:\nHomo sapiens is transcending those limits. It is now beginning to break\nthe laws of natural selection, replacing them with the laws of intelligent\ndesign.\nFor close to 4 billion years, every single organism on the planet\nevolved subject to natural selection. Not even one was designed by an\nintelligent creator. The giraffe, for example, got its long neck thanks to\ncompetition between archaic giraffes rather than to the whims of a\nsuper-intelligent being. Proto-giraffes who had longer necks had access\nto more food and consequently produced more offspring than did those\nwith shorter necks. Nobody, certainly not the giraffes, said, ‘A long neck\nwould enable giraffes to munch leaves off the treetops. Let’s extend it.’\nThe beauty of Darwin’s theory is that it does not need to assume an\nintelligent designer to explain how giraffes ended up with long necks.\nFor billions of years, intelligent design was not even an option,\nbecause there was no intelligence which could design things.\nMicroorganisms, which until quite recently were the only living things"

Yet, as best we know, microorganisms have no\nconsciousness, no aims in life, and no ability to plan ahead.\nAt some stage organisms such as giraffes, dolphins, chimpanzees and\nNeanderthals evolved consciousness and the ability to plan ahead. But\neven if a Neanderthal fantasised about fowls so fat and slow-moving that\nhe could just scoop them up whenever he was hungry, he had no way of\nturning that fantasy into reality. He had to hunt the birds that had been\nnaturally selected.\nThe first crack in the old regime appeared about 10,000 years ago,\nduring the Agricultural Revolution. Sapiens who dreamed of fat, slow-\nmoving chickens discovered that if they mated the fattest hen with the\nslowest cock, some of their offspring would be both fat and slow. If you\nmated those offspring with each other, you could produce a line of fat,\nslow birds. It was a race of chickens unknown to nature, produced by the\nintelligent design not of a god but of a human.\nStill, compared to an all-powerful deity, Homo sapiens had limited\ndesign skills. Sapiens could use selective breeding to detour around and\naccelerate the natural-selection processes that normally affected\nchickens, but they could not introduce completely new characteristics\nthat were absent from the genetic pool of wild chickens. In a way, the\nrelationship between Homo sapiens and chickens was similar to many\nother symbiotic relationships that have so often arisen on their own in\nnature. Sapiens exerted peculiar selective pressures on chickens that\ncaused the fat and slow ones to proliferate, just as pollinating bees select\nflowers, causing the bright colourful ones to proliferate.\nToday, the 4-billion-year-old regime of natural selection is facing a\ncompletely different challenge. In laboratories throughout the world,\nscientists are engineering living beings. They break the laws of natural\nselection with impunity, unbridled even by an organisms original\ncharacteristics. Eduardo Kac, a Brazilian bio-artist, decided in 2000 to\ncreate a new work of art: a fluorescent green rabbit.

It may turn out to be the most important biological revolution\nsince the appearance of life on earth. After 4 billion years of natural\nselection, Alba stands at the dawn of a new cosmic era, in which life will\nbe ruled by intelligent design. If this happens, the whole of human\nhistory up to that point might, with hindsight, be reinterpreted as a\nprocess of experimentation and apprenticeship that revolutionised the\ngame of life. Such a process should be understood from a cosmic\nperspective of billions of years, rather than from a human perspective of\nmillennia.\nBiologists the world over are locked in battle with the intelligent-\ndesign movement, which opposes the teaching of Darwinian evolution in\nschools and claims that biological complexity proves there must be a\ncreator who thought out all biological details in advance.

If successful, that would mean that after 4 billion years of\nmilling around inside the small world of organic compounds, life will\nsuddenly break out into the vastness of the inorganic realm, ready to\ntake up shapes beyond our wildest dreams. Not all scholars agree that\nthe mind works in a manner analogous to today’s digital computers –\nand if it doesn’t, present-day computers would not be able to simulate it.\nYet it would be foolish to categorically dismiss the possibility before\ngiving it a try.

Yet the world of 2014 is already a world in which culture is\nreleasing itself from the shackles of biology. Our ability to engineer not\nmerely the world around us, but above all the world inside our bodies\nand minds, is developing at breakneck speed. More and more spheres of\nactivity are being shaken out of their complacent ways.

The road to near-perfect medicine\nstands before us.\nHowever, with improvements in medical knowledge will come new\nethical conundrums. Ethicists and legal experts are already wrestling\nwith the thorny issue of privacy as it relates to DNA. Would insurance\ncompanies be entitled to ask for our DNA scans and to raise premiums if\nthey discover a genetic tendency to reckless behaviour? Would we be\nrequired to fax our DNA, rather than our CV, to potential employers?\nCould an employer favour a candidate because his DNA looks better? Or\ncould we sue in such cases for ‘genetic discrimination’? Could a company\nthat develops a new creature or a new organ register a patent on its DNA\nsequences? It is obvious that one can own a particular chicken, but can\none own an entire species?\nSuch dilemmas are dwarfed by the ethical, social and political\nimplications of the Gilgamesh Project and of our potential new abilities\nto create superhumans. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights,\ngovernment medical programmes throughout the world, national health\ninsurance programmes and national constitutions worldwide recognise\nthat a humane society ought to give all its members fair medical\ntreatment and keep them in relatively good health. That was all well and\ngood as long as medicine was chiefly concerned with preventing illness\nand healing the sick. What might happen once medicine becomes\npreoccupied with enhancing human abilities? Would all humans be\nentitled to such enhanced abilities, or would there be a new superhuman\nelite?\nOur late modern world prides itself on recognising, for the first time in\nhistory, the basic equality of all humans, yet it might be poised to create\nthe most unequal of all societies. Throughout history, the upper classes\nalways claimed to be smarter, stronger and generally better than the\nunderclass. They were usually deluding themselves. A baby born to a\npoor peasant family was likely to be as intelligent as the crown prince.\nWith the help of new medical capabilities, the pretensions of the upper\nclasses might soon become an objective reality.\nThis is not science fiction.

What is a spaceship compared to an eternally young\ncyborg who does not breed and has no sexuality, who can share thoughts\ndirectly with other beings, whose abilities to focus and remember are a\nthousand times greater than our own, and who is never angry or sad, but\nhas emotions and desires that we cannot begin to imagine?\nScience fiction rarely describes such a future, because an accurate\ndescription is by definition incomprehensible. Producing a film about the\nlife of some super-cyborg is akin to producing Hamlet for an audience of\nNeanderthals. Indeed, the future masters of the world will probably be\nmore different from us than we are from Neanderthals. Whereas we and\nthe Neanderthals are at least human, our inheritors will be godlike.\nPhysicists define the Big Bang as a singularity. It is a point at which all\nthe known laws of nature did not exist. Time too did not exist. It is thus\nmeaningless to say that anything existed ‘before’ the Big Bang. We may\nbe fast approaching a new singularity, when all the concepts that give\nmeaning to our world – me, you, men, women, love and hate – will\nbecome irrelevant. Anything happening beyond that point is meaningless\nto us.\nThe Frankenstein Prophecy\nIn 1818 Mary Shelley published Frankenstein, the story of a scientist who\ncreates an artificial being that goes out of control and wreaks havoc. In\nthe last two centuries, the same story has been told over and over again\nin countless versions. It has become a central pillar of our new scientific\nmythology. At first sight, the Frankenstein story appears to warn us that\nif we try to play God and engineer life we will be punished severely. Yet\nthe story has a deeper meaning.\nThe Frankenstein myth confronts Homo sapiens with the fact that the\nlast days are fast approaching.

This is something\nmost Sapiens find extremely disconcerting. We like to believe that in the\nfuture people just like us will travel from planet to planet in fast\nspaceships. We don’t like to contemplate the possibility that in the\nfuture, beings with emotions and identities like ours will no longer exist,\nand our place will be taken by alien life forms whose abilities dwarf our\nown.\nWe somehow find comfort in the idea that Dr Frankenstein created a\nterrible monster, whom we had to destroy in order to save ourselves. We\nlike to tell the story that way because it implies that we are the best of\nall beings, that there never was and never will be something better than\nus. Any attempt to improve us will inevitably fail, because even if our\nbodies might be improved, you cannot touch the human spirit.\nWe would have a hard time swallowing the fact that scientists could\nengineer spirits as well as bodies, and that future Dr Frankensteins could\ntherefore create something truly superior to us, something that will look\nat us as condescendingly as we look at the Neanderthals.\nWe cannot be certain whether today’s Frankensteins will indeed fulfil\nthis prophecy. The future is unknown, and it would be surprising if the\nforecasts of the last few pages were realised in full. History teaches us\nthat what seems to be just around the corner may never materialise due\nto unforeseen barriers, and that other unimagined scenarios will in fact\ncome to pass.

Less radical forecasts speak of the next century, or\nthe next millennium. Yet from the perspective of 70,000 years of Sapiens\nhistory, what are a few millennia?\nIf the curtain is indeed about to drop on Sapiens history, we members\nof one of its final generations should devote some time to answering one\nlast question: what do we want to become? This question, sometimes\nknown as the Human Enhancement question, dwarfs the debates that\ncurrently preoccupy politicians, philosophers, scholars and ordinary\npeople. After all, today’s debate between today’s religions, ideologies,\nnations and classes will in all likelihood disappear along with Homo\nsapiens. If our successors indeed function on a different level of\nconsciousness (or perhaps possess something beyond consciousness that\nwe cannot even conceive), it seems doubtful that Christianity or Islam\nwill be of interest to them, that their social organisation could be\nCommunist or capitalist, or that their genders could be male or female.\nAnd yet the great debates of history are important because at least the\nfirst generation of these gods would be shaped by the cultural ideas of\ntheir human designers. Would they be created in the image of\ncapitalism, of Islam, or of feminism? The answer to this question might\nsend them careening in entirely different directions.\nMost people prefer not to think about it. Even the field of bioethics\nprefers to address another question, ‘What is it forbidden to do?’ Is it\nacceptable to carry out genetic experiments on living human beings? On\naborted fetuses? On stem cells? Is it ethical to clone sheep? And\nchimpanzees? And what about humans? All of these are important\nquestions, but it is naïve to imagine that we might simply hit the brakes\nand stop the scientific projects that are upgrading Homo sapiens into a\ndifferent kind of being. For these projects are inextricably meshed\ntogether with the Gilgamesh Project. Ask scientists why they study the\ngenome, or try to connect a brain to a computer, or try to create a mind\ninside a computer. Nine out of ten times you’ll get the same standard\nanswer: we are doing it to cure diseases and save human lives. Even\nthough the implications of creating a mind inside a computer are far"

Since it is impossible to stop Gilgamesh, it is also impossible\nto stop Dr Frankenstein.\nThe only thing we can try to do is to influence the direction scientists\nare taking. Since we might soon be able to engineer our desires too,\nperhaps the real question facing us is not ‘What do we want to become?’,\nbut ‘What do we want to want?’ Those who are not spooked by this\nquestion probably haven’t given it enough thought."

Today it stands on the verge of\nbecoming a god, poised to acquire not only eternal youth, but also the\ndivine abilities of creation and destruction.\nUnfortunately, the Sapiens regime on earth has so far produced little\nthat we can be proud of. We have mastered our surroundings, increased\nfood production, built cities, established empires and created far-flung\ntrade networks. But did we decrease the amount of suffering in the\nworld? Time and again, massive increases in human power did not\nnecessarily improve the well-being of individual Sapiens, and usually\ncaused immense misery to other animals.\nIn the last few decades we have at last made some real progress as far\nas the human condition is concerned, with the reduction of famine,\nplague and war.
